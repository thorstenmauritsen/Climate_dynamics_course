\chapter{Preface}
Let us take a look at a planet from space -- and -- imagine we let time pass relatively quickly. From this perspective we can observe a system in approximate stationarity; something which we usually call equilibrium. This is not to be mistaken for a strict thermodynamical equilibrium, wherein, as you may have learnt in other courses, the system is characterised by a single well-defined temperature, but rather an approximate equilibrium between radiative energy received from the star around which our planet of interest is circulating (provided it does have a star), and the thermal energy that the planet is radiating to space. How does the planet come into equilibrium, and is there only one equilibrium? How does the equilibrium change if the star changes it's irradiance, or the planets orbit is altered? How does the equilibrium of the planet depend on properties of the planet? To begin to answer these questions we will have to dig into the processes that determine the energy balance, but the starting point will be our somewhat abstract perspective from space and time.

Usually we think of the climate as something that is static, we think of averages in time -- traditionally taken to be 30 years; a rather arbitrary choice as it turns out. So why discuss the dynamics of something that is static? The climate is varying on timescales as short as we choose to define them up to those of the existence of the planet. These variations were either due to external factors, such as the sun, or  the composition of the atmosphere changing due to biogeochemical processes, or internal variability. Much of this can be described by simple dynamical equations, as the dynamics of climate. A related and interesting field describes the dynamics of the atmosphere and ocean circulations and their biogeochemical cycles.

{\bf \LARGE Scope of the course}
\\
\\
\noindent In the Climate Dynamics course I hope to bring you close to the forefront of current knowledge in climate dynamics, and ideally to inspire you to ask interesting questions on your own. Beyond this ideal, I hope to provide you with a solid basis for appreciating the stability of Earth's climate, and how and why we think it has, and is, changing. You will learn about forcing, feedback mechanisms and climate sensitivity, about the timescales involved in the climate system, and I will have a special focus on instrumental record warming. 

The course is theoretical in the sense that we will be working with abstraction: simple models that explain some aspect of the system in a distilled way, either ignoring a number of factors or condensing them into simpler formulations. We will work both analytically and with simple computational models.

\chapter{Essentials}
\label{chapter:essentials}
Here I go over some of the basics of Earth's climatology, it's radiative properties and the energetic flows. This chapter is intended to provide a minimal background for the further studies. We will spend a bit extra time trying to understand what controls the height of the troposphere. 

\section{Temperature of the Earth and its atmosphere}
From basic thermodynamics we have learned that an isolated system has a well-defined temperature when it is in a thermodynamic equilibrium wherein there are only random brownian transfer of energy and no net fluxes exist. The Earth is very far from thermodynamic equilibrium, and instead about 173 Petawatt (PW: $10^{15}$W) are received from the sun and approximately the same amount is radiated to back to space in the form of reflected sunlight and as infrared radiation. In this case it makes sense to choose a more practical definition of Earth's temperature, for instance that temperature which is needed  needed to achieve equilibrium: the warmer it is the more infrared radiation it will radiate to space; at least in most cases. This is sometimes referred to as the Earth's radiation temperature at thermal equilibrium.

\caption{ Observational estimates of the Earth's energy balance from Stevens and Schwartz \citep{Stevens2012}. Yellow is sunlight, red is infrared radiation. The little whirl is turbulent sensible heat transfer and the green is latent heat transfer. } 
\label{fig:energy_flows}
\end{figure}

It is useful to consider the components of the global mean energy balance (Figure \ref{fig:energy_flows}). Here we consider the fluxes per meter squared surface area of the Earth (total area $510\cdot 10^{12}$ m$^2$). Energy flows in from the sun at 340 Wm$^{-2}$, about 100 of which are reflected back to space by clouds, aerosol particles or the surface. In the atmosphere some of the sunlight is absorbed, mostly by oxygen, ozone and water vapor, and the rest reaches and heats the surface. The surface gets rid of the heat again through emitting infrared radiation, and sensible and latent heat fluxes to the atmosphere. Of the emitted nearly 400 Wm$^{-2}$ infrared radiation most it is absorbed by the atmosphere

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=12 cm]{../external_figures/HadCRUT_absolute_timmean.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{ Observed annual mean near-surface temperature from HadCRUT. } 
\label{fig:HadCRUT_temperature_map}
\end{figure}

Partly because the sunlight is not distributed evenly over the Earth's surface it exhibits wildly varying temperatures near the surface with extremes from about -90$^\circ$C to +60$^\circ$C. Even in the annual longterm mean the coldest and warmest places differ by nearly 90 degrees (Figure \ref{fig:HadCRUT_temperature_map}). We will, however, often use a global mean surface temperature; today this is about 15$^\circ$C, or 288 K. These temperature gradients set up large energy flows in the atmosphere and oceans from warmer to colder regions. To get an idea of the magnitude of these transports one can inspect the zonal mean top-of-atmosphere radiation balance (Figure \ref{fig:ceres_fluxes}). The regions from about 36S to 36N receives more energy than is emitted back to space, whereas the high latitudes have an energy deficit. To compensate this, there must be a meridional energy transport from low to high latitudes in the oceans and in the atmosphere (It is left as an exercise to estimate the flux of energy from low to high latitudes). As a result, the temperature gradients on Earth are, in fact, modest. For instance, the Moon has equatorial temperatures varying from about 100 to 390 K between day and night, and even colder temperatures have been measured in craters near the poles.

The red area shows regions where more energy is received than emitted, it extends approximately from 36S to 36N and has a mean of 36.5 Wm$^{-2}$. The blue areas are regions that emit more radiation to space than they receive. In the Southern Hemisphere the mean flux is -54.0 Wm$^{-2}$ and in the Northern Hemisphere the deficit is -54.7 Wm$^{-2}$. Note that the x-axis is plotted as sinus of latitude such that the area under the curves can be integrated. } 
\label{fig:ceres_fluxes}
\end{figure}

On average, the coldest point in the Earth's troposphere is the tropical tropopause region with temperatures around 200 K (Figure \ref{fig:tropical_profiles}). These low temperatures are achieved through vertical mixing in deep convective clouds wherein localized rapidly rising motion causes adiabatic cooling due to the decreasing pressure with height. If the air was dry the temperature would decrease at a rate of about -10 K km$^{-1}$, but because some latent heat is released as water vapor condenses during the ascent, the actual lapse rate is less, about -6 K km$^{-1}$, tending towards the dry adiabat in the upper troposphere (Figure \ref{fig:tropical_profiles}). This is referred to as the moist adiabat.

Unlike the horizontal temperature gradients at the Earth's surface, mostly from equator to poles, that cause energy to be transported in the oceans and the atmosphere, the vertical temperature gradient of about 100 K in the topical troposphere is not on it's own causing transports to occur. However, as we shall see in a moment radiative cooling causes an upward convective  transport of energy to balance the budget of the atmosphere.

\section{Radiative properties}
Let us next focus our attention on the infrared or longwave part of the Earth's radiation budget. A wealth of information can be obtained from studying the spectrum of radiation emitted from the Earth, stars and from other planets. This is because molecules have unique absorption properties that are determined by quantum mechanics. There are a number of ways in which atoms and molecules can absorb a photon, most of which happen at nearly discrete energies. Visible light is able to excite the electron states of atoms and highly energetic ultraviolet photons can split molecules apart. In the infrared, where photons each contain less energy, absorption happens mostly by exciting various modes of vibrations of molecules. 

Some molecules are unable to interact with infrared radiation, in fact the abundant nitrogen (N$_2$) and oxygen (O$_2$) molecules that constitute 99 percent of Earth's atmosphere are unable to absorb the low-energy infrared photons emitted by the Earth's surface. The simple configuration of these molecules with two atoms connected by electron bonds do not allow the absorption of a photon by vibration. More complex molecules with three or more atoms, such as water vapor (H$_2$O), carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), methane (CH$_4$) and ozone (O$_3$), can typically vibrate or rotate in a number of ways and are therefore what we call greenhouse gases. 

A useful starting point to appreciate the information in the infrared spectrum is to consider the radiation emitted by an ideal black body which constitutes a continuous and smooth spectrum called the Planck spectrum. Ideal black bodies are not necessarily black: if warm enough they can emit visible light, instead the blackness refers to them absorbing all incoming radiation perfectly, which is necessary to obtain the ideal emission spectrum because emissivity equals absorptivity. Examples of nearly ideal black bodies are the Sun, most solids and liquids. The surface of the Earth, be it the ocean or the land, is closely approximated as a black body. A cloud is also a surprisingly good absorber: a typical low-level liquid cloud consisting of suspended tiny droplets can be a nearly ideal black body if it contains a meager 20 gm${-2}$ of water. Gases, on the other contrary, are usually far from ideal black bodies. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=17 cm]{../external_figures/GW_Petty_IRIS_Tropical_Western_Pacific.png}
\end{center}
\caption{ Classical irradiance spectrum measured by the infrared interferometer spectrometer (IRIS) for measuring the emission spectra of the earth/atmosphere system aboard the Nimbus-4 satellite. The instrument is limited to the range 400 to 1600 cm$^{-1}$, and outside simplistic extrapolations are made. The measurements were made in the 1970's and are restricted to clear sky scenes. Dashed lines show idealized black body spectra. Blue shading illustrates the effect of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$). The other dip at 1000-1100 cm$^{-1}$ is due to ozone (O$_3$), and the flanks (less than 600 and more than 1200 cm$^{-1}$) are dominated by vapor vapor (H$_2$O), as well as methane (CH$_4$) at around 1200-1400 cm$^{-1}$. In the atmospheric window between 10 and 13 $\mu$m there are multiple weak absorption lines from water vapor. } 
\label{fig:radiation_spectrum}
\end{figure}

Several spectra of such ideal black bodies are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:radiation_spectrum} for temperatures from 200 to 300 K as dashed lines. Also shown is the emission spectrum from a tropical cloud free scene as measured from space. The plot is linear in wavenumber such that shorter wavelength, corresponding to more energetic photons, are situated to the right. The warmer the black body the further both the peak and the tail extends to the right. For reference light that is visible to the eye is at 0.7-0.4 $\mu$m. Also the area under the spectra, which are proportional to the total irradiance from the black body which is a strong function of temperature:
\begin{equation}
R_b = -\sigma T^4,
\label{eq:blackbody}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\sigma=5.67\cdot 10^{-8}$ Wm$^{-2}$K$^{-4}$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Most solids and liquids can be considered nearly ideal black bodies, including the Earth's surface. Also thick clouds act as if they were nearly ideal black bodies.

Now, let us compare the ideal black body spectra with the actual spectrum measured over the tropical Pacific (Figure \ref{fig:radiation_spectrum}): The observed spectrum is indeed far from ideal, which is a consequence of the atmosphere being between the satellite and the Earth's surface. Parts of the spectrum (10-13 $\mu$m), sometimes referred to as the atmospheric window, are actually quite close to the black body spectrum of the surface temperature in this tropical region (298 K), but other parts are much colder, 215 K at about 15 $\mu$m, or considerably colder with 260-270 K at both long and short wavelengths. We call these brightness temperatures as they are the equivalent irradiance of an ideal black body.
The reason that parts of the spectrum is suppressed relative to that of a black body with the surface temperature is that it is not only the surface that is emitting but also the greenhouse gases of the atmosphere absorb and emit radiation. The temperature with which they effectively emit is a result of the individual molecules absorption properties, their mixing ratio profiles, and the atmospheric density and temperature profiles (Figure \ref{fig:tropical_profiles}):
\begin{itemize}
\item
Take first carbon dioxide (CO$_2$). It has a uniform and relatively high mixing ratio and it absorbs well around 13-17 $\mu$m (Figure \ref{fig:radiation_spectrum}, blue shading). The result is that most of the emission in the band around 15 $\mu$m comes from the upper troposphere where the atmospheric density is still high enough. Above the tropopause (about 18 km) the temperature rises again, and actually some of the emission in the center of the CO$_2$ dominated band originates in the stratosphere which is somewhat warmer than the troposphere as marked by a spike. 
\item
For the water vapor (H$_2$O) dominated flanks of the spectrum, however, the story is different. Water vapor is most abundant in the lower troposphere (Figure \ref{fig:tropical_profiles}), and most of the radiation emitted by water vapor originates from there. This results in the Earth's spectrum being closer to that of a black body with 260-270 K at the flanks consistent with temperatures at about 5-7 km in the tropics.
\item
Finally, let us consider ozone (O$_3$) which increases in mixing ratio with height and is most abundant in the stratosphere where it is produced by photodissociation of oxygen molecules by an ultraviolet photon ($\nu$): 2O$_2 +\nu$ $\rightarrow$ 2O + O$_2$ $\rightarrow$ O + O$_3$ $\rightarrow$ 2O$_2$. Most of the ozone mass is at 20-25 km altitude, whereas the volume mixing ratio peaks higher up at 30-40 km. Ozone absorbs infrared radiation at 9-10 $\mu$m wavelength where we see a brightness temperature of about 270-280 K. Most of this radiation originates in the stratosphere, which is warmer than the upper troposphere, and therefore the depression is not as deep as for the CO$_2$ case.
\end{itemize}
I hope you have now a bit of an impression of the power of the infrared spectrum. We shall return to it on later occasions. 

\section{The tropopause}
The transition zone between the troposphere and the stratosphere plays a central role in several of the themes related to the dynamics of climate. The tropopause plays a key role in determining the forcing from greenhouse gases, and it is central to understanding certain feedback mechanisms.

Perhaps a good starting point is the now iconic single-column simulations by Manabe and Strickler presented in their 1964-paper\citep{Manabe1964} (Figure \ref{fig:rce_manabe}). In their model they prescribed profiles of ozone and water vapor, and let the sun shine. A large fraction of the sunlight passes to the surface which is relatively warm. In the simplest case of a pure radiative equilibrium the surface reaches about 340 K whereas the troposphere is colder than observed. The pure radiative equilibrium is that the radiation absorbed and emitted at a given level is equal. However, in case the temperature drops this quickly with height then convective instability will occur. To parameterize this Manabe and Strickler adjusted the profile to first a dry adiabat (-10 K/km) and then to a more realistic lapse-rate close to the moist adiabat (-6.5 K/km). The result is that the troposphere is warmer and the surface is colder than at pure radiative equilibrium. Note how the stratosphere is not reacting much. Here instead the temperature rises with altitude and therefore no convective instability arises. The stratosphere also cools in the infrared, but it is being heated by absorption of sunlight mostly by the ozone layer. In summary: the convection acts to heat the troposphere in order to compensate radiative cooling -- we say it is in radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) -- whereas the stratosphere is roughly in a radiative equilibrium. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10 cm]{../external_figures/Manabe_Strickler_1964_figure.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{ Solutions to radiative and radiative-convective equilibrium in the single-column model by Manabe and Strickler\citep{Manabe1964}.   } 
\label{fig:rce_manabe}
\end{figure}

It is the greenhouse gases that act to cool the troposphere by emitting infrared radiation through radiative flux divergence. If we define a net flux as the difference between an upward and a downward component ($R_{net}(z) = R^\downarrow(z) - R^\uparrow(z)$, where $z$ is height), then we can calculate the heating rate as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{1}{c_p \rho}\frac{dR_{net}}{dz},
\end{equation}
where $c_p$ is the heat capacity of air and $\rho$ the density of air. Figure \ref{fig:radiative_cooling} shows infrared heating rates that are due to individual greenhouse gases in the tropical cloud-free profile displayed in Figure \ref{fig:tropical_profiles}. The heating rates are mostly negative and on the order of degrees per day, that is, if no other process would be acting to keep the temperature in place it would change at this rate. Ozone is the exception which heats the atmosphere in the lower stratosphere. But above 30 km ozone is also cooling the atmosphere, and it does so by radiating both upwards and downwards. It is partly this downwards flux from the warm upper stratosphere aloft that is being absorbed in the colder lower stratosphere. There are at least three controls that conspire to have the troposphere where it is:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Water vapor dominates infrared cooling in the troposphere, and is the reason that the pure radiative equilibrium case of Manabe and Strickler (Figure \ref{fig:rce_manabe}) has such a cold troposphere. However, water vapor mixing ratio decreases rapidly with height because the holding capacity decreases with temperature according to Clausius-Clapeyron. At around 15 km altitude, or more importantly around 200 K temperature, the cooling due to water vapor is nearly zero. It is thought that in a warming climate the tropical tropospheric temperature will increase to maintain roughly a moist adiabat, such that the level at which the temperature reaches 200 K moves upward, and with it the water vapor cooling and consequently the tropopause (Hartmann and Larsson\cite{Hartmann2002}). {\em Radiative cooling by water vapor comes to an end.}
\item
Another way to look at this is that the heating caused by moist convection, which is to compensate the radiative cooling, can only function as long as the moist and dry adiabats are different. The ascending air inside deep convective clouds follow approximately the moist adiabat which generally has a lower lapse-rate of temperature with height than the dry adiabat. The heating due to convection occurs as the surrounding air subsides, as a result of continuity, instead along a dry adiabat. However, at very cold temperatures, around 200 K, the moist and dry adiabats are practically the same as there is very little water vapor left to condense, and it follows that the convection can no longer heat the troposphere. This sets another control on the tropopause height. {\em Heating by moist convection comes to an end.}
\item
Absorption of sunlight by ozone is the main source of heating in the stratosphere and results in the increasing temperature with height which hinders convection from penetrating deeper. Ozone has a relatively long lifetime in the stratosphere but if it ends up in the troposphere it is quickly destroyed. So the ozone layer has to move up to stay above a rising tropopause in a warming climate. If this leads to a thinning of the ozone layer perhaps more ultraviolet radiation can penetrate into and heat the upper troposphere, thereby increasing the temperature of the tropopause. {\em Ozone heating may bound the rise.}
\end{itemize}
Understanding the actual behavior of the tropopause is a field of active research, and the rise of the tropopause with warming plays an important role in determining climate change feedbacks.

\chapter{Energy balance}
\label{chapter:energybalance}
The flows of energy in and out of the planet is central to climate dynamics; it is actually more important to keep track of the energy balance than it is to trace surface temperature which  represents only a small part of the Earth's total heat reservoir. The temperature, however, plays a central role in determining this balance: in essence a planet receives energy at some rate and therefore warms up until it loses energy at the same rate. In fact, whereas a planet in general can receive energy in a number of ways, infrared radiation is basically the only way in which it can get rid of it again.

\section{The black body case}
Most of the Earth's energy is received from the Sun in the form of shortwave radiation, sunlight. At the Earth's distance from the Sun this corresponds to a flux of little more than 1360 Wm$^{-2}$ through a sphere centered at the Sun. This number is often referred to as the solar constant, or $S_o$, although it is not really to be considered constant. There are other small sources of energy such as geothermal heat from the interior of the Earth and heat generated by dissipation of tides, but these can be safely neglected. On other planets or moons, however, this need not be the case.

Because the distance between the Sun and the Earth is vast compared to their respective radii, we can assume that all incoming sunlight is parallel, which makes it easy to calculate the average sunlight per unit area of the Earth's surface. The radiation is intercepted by the Earth cross-section which is roughly that of a disc with the average radius of the Earth ($r$), or $\pi r^2$. But the surface area of the Earth is larger, roughly $4\pi r^2$. It follows that the intercepted sunlight must be spread over a four times larger area, giving a mean incident flux of about 340 Wm$^{-2}$. In addition, not all the incoming sunlight is absorbed, but as we saw in the previous chapter about 100 Wm$^{-2}$ is reflected back to space by clouds, aerosol particles and the surface. We say that the Earth has a planetary albedo of $\alpha \approx 100/340 \approx 0.29$. It follows that the absorbed sunlight is $R_s=(1-\alpha)S_o/4$. Finally, we shall assume that the Earth's surface has a single uniform temperature, that it radiates to space as an ideal black body following Equation \ref{eq:blackbody}, and that the atmosphere is fully transparent to infrared radiation.
Now we are in a position to form a first estimate of the energy balance ($N$) :
\begin{eqnarray}
N &=& R_s + R_b \nonumber \\ 
   &=& \frac{S_o}{4}(1-\alpha) - \sigma T_e^4,
\label{eq:black_body_energy_balance}
\end{eqnarray}
\noindent where $T_e$ is an effective, or emission, temperature of the Earth that it would have had had it been an ideal black body. The balance  can be solved by setting $N=0$:
\begin{equation}
T_e = \sqrt[4]{S_o(1-\alpha)/4\sigma}. 
\end{equation}
Inserting reasonable values we obtain $T_e \approx$  255 K. This is considerably colder than the global mean surface temperature of the Earth ($T_s$) which is currently about 288 K. But remembering the observed spectrum of Earth in Figure \ref{fig:radiation_spectrum} perhaps this is not too surprising; a large part of the spectrum is at a lower brightness temperature than that of the surface. The found emission temperature is that of the ideal black body that would average the Earth's infrared radiance to space (remember the observation in Figure \ref{fig:radiation_spectrum} is a cloud-free scene from the tropics which is warmer than average).

\section{The greenhouse effect}
The reason the surface of the Earth is about 33 K warmer than the emission temperature is the so-called greenhouse effect, which was first suggested to exist by Fourier in his essay from 1827; a nice 1-page perspective on that paper is provided by Pierrehumbert \cite{Pierrehumbert2004}. Fourier formulated the question of what determines Earth's temperature and developed the idea of the planetary energy balance which is the foundation of climate science. 

\begin{figure}

\end{center}
\caption{ Illustration of the greenhouse effect by Pierrehumbert \cite{Pierrehumbert2004}. Heat is lost by infrared radiation (pink arrows) but some of that emitted by the warm surface is absorbed and re-emitted by the cooler troposphere. The thick red line shows an idealized temperature profile. The result is that the surface has to become warmer compared to the case when there is no atmosphere in order to obtain energy balance.    } 
\label{fig:greenhouse_effect_illustration}
\end{figure}

It is often argued that the naming of the greenhouse effect is misleading. The greenhouses, which we use to grow vegetables and fruits, are indeed warmer than their surroundings because sunlight is trapped inside, but they are warmer mainly because they hinder air motion from transporting the excess heat away. This is fundamentally different from how the atmospheric greenhouse effect works which is by absorbing infrared radiation emitted by the surface and re-emitting at a lower temperature to space resulting in a warmer surface (Figure \ref{fig:greenhouse_effect_illustration}). We can define the greenhouse effect as the difference between the infrared radiation emitted by the surface ($R^\uparrow_{ir}(\textrm{sfc})$) and that which escapes to space ($R_{ir}(\textrm{toa})$), and then assume the fluxes are consistent with those of black bodies at the emission- and surface temperatures:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textrm{Greenhouse effect}&\equiv&   R_{ir}(\textrm{toa}) - R^\uparrow_{ir}(\textrm{sfc}) \nonumber \\ 
                                           &\approx&   -\sigma (T_e^4 - T_s^4) \nonumber \\
                                           &\approx& 150 \ \textrm{Wm}^{-2}, \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
which is a bit less than the estimate by Stevens and Schwartz of 155-160 Wm$^{-2}$ (Figure \ref{fig:energy_flows}). It is easy to understand why our estimate is smaller. The black body radiation depends on the temperature to the fourth power and so if there are inhomogeneous distributed surface temperatures, such as is the case at Earth's surface ($T_s$), then the average emitted radiation is larger than that of a uniform black body with the same average temperature.

\section{The perfectly absorbing slab atmosphere}
To emulate a greenhouse effect we may consider a single-temperature, or slab, atmosphere that is perfectly transmissive to sunlight but a black body absorber in the infrared. We may think of this as a slab of perfect greenhouse gas. The atmosphere radiates up and down as an ideal black body. At the top of this atmosphere (toa) the same energy balance must hold as for the pure black body case (Eq. \ref{eq:black_body_energy_balance}). At the surface (sfc), in addition to the unhindered downwelling solar irradiance, also downwelling infrared radiation comes from the atmosphere, while the surface radiates upward: 
\begin{eqnarray}
N_\textrm{toa} &=&  \frac{S_o}{4}(1-\alpha) - \sigma T_e^4  \\ 
N_\textrm{sfc} &=&  \frac{S_o}{4}(1-\alpha) + \sigma T_e^4 - \sigma T_s^4  \nonumber
\label{eq:perfect_greenhouse}
\end{eqnarray}
and at equilibrium we have energy balances both at the top-of-atmosphere and at the surface, $N_\textrm{toa}=N_\textrm{sfc}=0$, so that we can solve for surface temperature for a single layer atmosphere:
\begin{equation}
T_s(1) = \sqrt[4]{S_o(1-\alpha)2/4\sigma}. 
\end{equation}
Putting in reasonable numbers we obtain a surface temperature of 304 K -- substantially warmer than that on Earth -- and a whopping greenhouse effect of 243 Wm$^{-2}$. Now, let us double the amount of our perfect greenhouse slab by adding another layer to obtain the solution (it is left as an exercise to show this):
\begin{equation}
T_s(2) = \sqrt[4]{S_o(1-\alpha)3/4\sigma},
\label{eq:ntwo}
\end{equation}
or in the general case with $n$ levels:
\begin{equation}
T_s(n) = \sqrt[4]{S_o(1-\alpha)(n+1)/4\sigma},
\end{equation}
such that the temperature increases monotonically with the number of perfect greenhouse slabs. Eventually, the approximations made above must break down when the surface gets so hot that it radiates visible light which can escape unhindered through this idealized atmosphere. 

Obviously, and perhaps luckily, we do not have such a perfect greenhouse slab in the Earth's atmosphere, rather individual gases only absorb in parts of the infrared spectrum. In the bands around 15 $\mu$m where CO$_2$ absorbs the atmosphere is virtually opaque to radiation, but at other wavelengths infrared radiation from the surface or lower troposphere can escape to space (Figure \ref{fig:radiation_spectrum}). It is sometimes incorrectly argued that because the atmosphere is nearly saturated in the CO$_2$ absorption bands then adding more will not act to warm the Earth's surface. However, the example above with $n$ completely opaque greenhouse gas slabs nicely illustrates the opposite: the more slabs you add, the warmer is your surface temperature.

\section{The partially absorbing slab atmosphere}
\label{sec:partially_absorbing_slab}
It is therefore useful to think of the atmosphere as partially absorbing. Commonly this is modelled using an effective emissivity that is less than unity, sometimes referred to as the gray body case, or gray radiation case. 
It is the purpose of an exercise to study this case and estimate the effective emissivity of the Earth and to show that the result is analogous to what we shall find below. 
Perhaps a physically more revealing approach is to consider an atmosphere layer analog to the perfect greenhouse case above that transmits all solar radiation but absorbs and emits in only a fraction $f$ of the infrared spectrum. The problem is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:partially_absorbing_atmosphere}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=12 cm]{../illustrations/Partially_absorbing_atmosphere}
\end{center}
\caption{ The energy balance for the partially absorbing slab atmosphere.    } 
\label{fig:partially_absorbing_atmosphere}
\end{figure}

Now, let $T_s$ be the surface temperature and $T_a$ be the atmosphere temperature. Unlike in the perfect greenhouse slab case, we cannot assume that the atmosphere temperature equals the emission temperature, $T_e$. We can then set up balances at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface:
\begin{eqnarray}
N_\textrm{toa} &=&  \frac{S_o}{4}(1-\alpha) - f \sigma T_a^4 - (1-f)\sigma T_s^4 \nonumber \\ 
N_\textrm{sfc} &=&  \frac{S_o}{4}(1-\alpha) + f \sigma T_a^4 - \sigma T_s^4 \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
Again, we can assume stationarity and solve for $T_s$ and $T_a$:
\begin{equation}
T_s(f) = \sqrt[4]{\frac{S_o(1-\alpha)}{2\sigma(2-f)}}, \ T_a(f) =  \sqrt[4]{\frac{S_o(1-\alpha)}{4\sigma(2-f)}},
\label{eq:partial_absorbtion_solution}
\end{equation}
such that we see that $T_s > T_a$ under all conditions and that they both increase with increasing $f$. For the limit $f \rightarrow 1$ we obtain $T_a \rightarrow T_e$ as in Equation \ref{eq:perfect_greenhouse}, and in the opposite case $f \rightarrow 0$ we obtain $T_s \rightarrow T_e$ as in the ideal black body case of Equation \ref{eq:black_body_energy_balance}. We may also solve for $f$ instead:
\begin{equation}
f = 2 - \frac{S_o(1-\alpha)}{2\sigma T_s^4},
\end{equation}
which for Earth-like conditions gives $f \approx 0.76$, that is, three quarters of the infrared radiation emitted from the surface has to be absorbed by the greenhouse slab if we are to get a surface temperature of 288 K. To obtain balance here, the atmosphere has to be colder than $T_e$, about 242 K. We can understand this as some of the radiation can escape from the surface directly space, so that to obtain energy balance with the incoming solar radiation the atmosphere has to be colder than 255 K such that the average emission temperature is $T_e$. In the limit $f \rightarrow 0$ the atmospheric temperature is about 215 K, but of course, strictly in the limit that temperature looses meaning as no radiation is absorbed and emitted from the atmosphere anymore.


\section{Greenhouse effect of a gaseous atmosphere}
Now in practical cases the atmosphere does not consist of a single, or multiple slabs in radiative equilibrium with the incoming solar radiation and the outgoing infrared radiation, rather it consists of gases, clouds and perhaps some particulate matter. An important property of a gaseous atmosphere is that it is relatively mobile, so that it can overturn and react on timescales comparable to those of radiative heating and cooling. As a first approximation we can think of this by the troposphere having a reasonably fixed lapse-rate with height. For dry mixing this would be about -10 K/km, but as discussed earlier the real atmosphere cools less rapidly with height due to release of latent heat in convective clouds.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8 cm]{../illustrations/Gaseous_atmosphere_radiation_level}
\end{center}
\caption{ Illustration of the concept of a radiation level pressure for an optically thick atmosphere. With more greenhouse gas (red) the radiation level moves upward and therefore the surface and atmosphere has to warm in order to again radiate as $-\sigma T_e$ to space.   } 
\label{fig:radiation_level}
\end{figure}

Let us start with an atmosphere that is fully transparent to infrared radiation. Here we may think of the Earth's dry atmosphere absent of carbon dioxide, ozone, methane etc. That is, it could for instance consist of nitrogen or oxygen. Then we are effectively having the black body case (Eq. \ref{eq:black_body_energy_balance}) wherein $T_s = T_e$. Then let us add some small amount of a perfect greenhouse gas, one that absorbs equally well at all infrared wavelengths. We shall assume that it is equally distributed everywhere, such as is the case for carbon dioxide (Figure \ref{fig:tropical_profiles}), with a concentration $q$. Trace gas concentrations are fractions typically measured in parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb).

As we look at this atmosphere from space the radiation emitted towards us is then  a mixture of radiation from different heights. If $q$ is very small some of the radiation emitted by the surface may escape directly to space without being absorbed by the greenhouse gas molecules: some of the photons can slip through, and we call the atmosphere optically thin. In the other limit, if $q$ is large then even a small fraction of the atmospheric column can act as if it was a black body. The pressure thickness of such a layer will scale with the amount greenhouse molecules, $q \Delta p/g$, such that the larger $q$ is, the smaller $\Delta p$ has to be. As we view our optically thick atmosphere from space we will almost exclusively see radiation coming from the uppermost part ($\Delta p$) and it will be characterized by the temperature that prevails in this layer. In this case it may be useful to think of the infrared radiation as coming from a certain radiation level, $p_r < p_s$, that is the height at which the temperature equals the emission temperature, $T_e$. The concept is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:radiation_level}.

As we add more greenhouse gas to our atmosphere then the pressure thickness, $\Delta p$, required to act as a black body decreases, and so with it $p_r$ becomes smaller. Therefore the emission level moves upward in the atmosphere to lower pressure. But since the emission temperature, $T_e$, is constrained to be that which closes the energy budget of the planet (in the case of Earth $T_e \approx 255$ K) then the whole atmosphere as well as the surface has to warm up. This is because the surface and atmosphere are dynamically coupled by mixing processes to follow closely a certain lapse-rate.

In a nutshell, the reason there is a greenhouse effect is that the atmosphere absorbs some of the radiation emitted by the surface and re-emits at a lower temperature to space. To achieve this the atmosphere has to be colder than the surface; something which is ensured through convective mixing.

% ROUND OFF with a section arguing that greenhouse gases cause greenhouse effect if the atmosphere is colder than the surface and further that greenhouse gases, by cooling the atmosphere, ensure this to happen.


\section{A note on signs}
As you may have already noticed, throughout this set of notes I will count all fluxes as positive downwards. This has the advantage that positive fluxes will act to warm- and negative fluxes cool the system. Likewise, the feedback parameter that we shall define in the next chapter is automatically negative for stable climates and positive for unstable climates. The downside is that the {\em outgoing longwave radiation} emitted by the Earth (OLR) is then a negative flux -- where possible I shall denote it {\em net longwave radiation} trying to avoid confusion. Also note that some figures that I borrow can use the definition where OLR is positive. In the literature a number of sign conventions have developed, and it is worth paying close attention when reading on.

\chapter{Response to small perturbations}
\label{chapter:response}
\vspace{1 cm}

Up until now we considered climates that were stationary, at balance between the absorbed solar radiation and the emitted infrared radiation. We call this a stationary state or a fix-point. But what happens if the system is starting a bit away from that stationary state? Or what happens if we take a system in a stationary state and somehow force it in a way that causes an energy imbalance to occur? This naturally leads us to develop the concepts of radiative forcing, climate change feedbacks and a resulting equilibrium climate sensitivity.
In this chapter we shall assume the perturbations are small such that we can linearize the system.  A surprisingly large part of the discussion around climate change is actually limited to this first-order linear regime and so it makes sense to spend some time on it. In a later chapter we shall explore systems wherein linearity can no longer be assumed and the associated concepts begin to fall apart.

\end{figure}


\section{Climate stability}
In one perspective the Earth's climate has varied in rich ways in the past, in another perspective it has been remarkably stable (Figure \ref{fig:Paleo_temperature_timeseries}). The past 6.000 years we have had nearly steady temperatures, a period called the Holocene. These relatively mild conditions, wherein modern human civilization developed, have been rare in the past 1.000.000 years wherein the climate has cycled between longer colder glacial periods interrupted by short interglacials. Before that the Earth was warmer than it is today. For instance during Pliocene CO$_2$ concentrations were close to what they are today, about 400 ppm, and temperatures higher than during Holocene by about 2-3 K. Much earlier, during the Eocene temperatures were warmer, maybe by 10-15 K. These differences on the one hand translated into substantially different conditions for life to unfold on the planet. On the other hand, from a physical point of view the Eocene was merely 5 percent warmer than today, as measured on an absolute temperature scale. 
On this background it makes intuitive sense to think that Earth's climate is stable to small perturbations in the context of it's known history: The system did not venture to completely different states and it did spend enough time to equilibrate at almost any temperature within the range visited since dinosaurs ruled the Earth 65 million years ago (Figure \ref{fig:Paleo_temperature_timeseries}); we shall return to estimating the time-scales for equilibrating in the next chapter. It is worth pointing out though that the mere fact that temperatures did not substantially change over that period does not imply that the Earth is {\em insensitive} to perturbations, rather climate has been relatively constant due to the compensation between a longterm increase in $S_o$ and a simultaneous decrease in atmospheric CO$_2$ as carbon has been buried in fossil sediments. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=17 cm]{../illustrations/Feedback_stability_cases.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{ Illustration of stability cases near stationary states as marked by the black dots whereat imbalance is zero. I consider all the light gray cases where $d N/ d T = 0$ at the fix-point as limiting cases. } 
\label{fig:feedback_stability_cases}
\end{figure}

For a state to be stable it must not only have zero imbalance ($N=0$) but it must also be stable to small perturbations. The latter requires that there is some restoring force such that if the system finds itself a bit away from stationarity, then that force will act to move the system back towards the fix-point. We can think of these perturbations as arising due to internal variability, due to weather phenomena or climate variability, or due to external forcing such as fluctuations in the solar constant or changes in atmospheric composition for reasons we consider external to the system, e.g. anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. For a complex system such as the Earth's climate this may be difficult to visualize as there is a practically near-infinite number of state-variables. But for many purposes we think of the climate system as having a single state-variable, the global mean surface temperature as we did it in the previous chapter, and in this case we can visualize the problem more easily (Figure \ref{fig:feedback_stability_cases}). In trying to consolidate this one-dimensional view, we may think of all the state variables as being functions of the global mean temperature. 

Now suppose $T_o$ is a fixed-point at which the imbalance is zero and that in {\em some region} above and below $T_o$ the imbalance, $N$, is a continuous and differentiable function of $T$. Then for cases wherein $dN/dT \ne 0$ the fix-points are either stable if $dN/dT < 0$, where the derivative is evaluated at $T_o$, as in some region above $T_o$ the imbalance has to be negative and the system will cool towards $T_o$, and vice-versa if the system is colder than $T_o$ it will warm up again. A similar argument can be made that the system is unstable if $dN/dT > 0$. These two possibilities are displayed as black lines in cases a and c in Figure \ref{fig:feedback_stability_cases}. We shall refer to $dN/dT$ as the feedback parameter ($\lambda$), and the above summarizes that for cases whereat $N(T_o) = 0$ the stability is determined as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
\lambda(T_o) < 0&:& T_o \textrm{ is a stable fix-point} \nonumber \\ 
\lambda(T_o) > 0&:& T_o \textrm{ is an unstable fix-point} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
which is the take-home message of this section.

We talked above about stability in {\em some region} around a fix-point, but what does that mean? How large does the region have to be? It depends on how large the perturbations considered to be relevant are, if there is a faint risk of approaching another fix-point. If a stable and an unstable fix-point exists in immediate vicinity, such as shown by the dashed line in Figure \ref{fig:feedback_stability_cases}, then the stable solution is only stable to small perturbations. If it is pushed hard to temperatures above those of the unstable fix-point, then it will not return to the stable fix-point, but instead continue to warm because there $N>0$. Eventually, the system may then encounter another stable fix-point and settle at warmer temperatures. 

In the rare limiting cases wherein both $N=0$ and $dN/dT = 0$ at the fix point things get a bit more complicated. In this case it makes sense to evaluate $N$ on either side of the fix point. If $N>0$ at somewhat colder $T$ and $N<0$ at slightly warmer $T$ then the system is stable to small perturbations, as illustrated for the gray case a in Figure \ref{fig:feedback_stability_cases}. The same argument can be used for the limiting unstable case, c. In the marginally stable cases (b) wherein $N$ has the same sign on either side of the fix-point the system is stable to perturbations in one direction and unstable to perturbations in the other direction. Think of yourself as standing on a small plateau on the side of a slippery cliff. If you try to climb up the mountain you will slide back towards the plateau (stable), but if you move a bit in the other direction you fall off the cliff and never get back to your starting point (unstable). Marginally stable fix-points occur when a system undergoes so-called bifurcations, a topic we shall return to in a later chapter.

Now let us be more concrete in applying the stability criterion we derived above. We will start with a version of the energy balance equation that you developed in an exercise of the previous chapter. In this case the greenhouse effect is represented by an effective emissivity, $\epsilon$, which is less than or equal to unity:
\begin{equation}
N = \frac{S_o}{4}(1-\alpha) - \epsilon \sigma T_s^4,
\end{equation}
from which we can estimate the feedback parameter by taking the derivative yielding:
\begin{equation}
\lambda = -\frac{S_o}{4}\frac{d\alpha}{dT_s} - \sigma T_s^4 \frac{d\epsilon}{dT_s} - 4 \epsilon \sigma T_s^3,
\label{eq:lambda_general}
\end{equation}
in the general case where $\epsilon$ and $\alpha$ are dependent on temperature. We can think of the first term as shortwave feedback which arises due to changes in planetary albedo. The origin of such feedbacks could be changes in surface albedo, e.g. through the melting of bright snow and ice, or through changes in the cloudiness and water vapor. The two other terms are infrared or longwave feedbacks. The middle term encapsulates changes in the Earth's emissivity with temperature, as we shall see e.g. due to increasing water vapor and rising upper-level clouds with warming. The last term is what is often referred to as the Planck feedback parameter.

If we consider a system with constant $\epsilon$ and $\alpha$ then the only term remaining is the Planck feedback for which we have:
\begin{equation}
\lambda_P = - 4 \epsilon \sigma T_s^3 < 0 
\label{eq:lambda_planck}
\end{equation}
for all $T_s$ implying that this system is unconditionally stable. If we insert numbers typical for the Earth we obtain obtain $\lambda_p \approx$ -3.25 Wm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$ which is surprisingly close to the value obtained from complex climate models, as we shall see later. The second term on the right hand side of equation \ref{eq:lambda_general}, which is broadly to be thought of as water vapor feedback (plus something called lapse-rate feedback), is found in climate models to be about +1.2 Wm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$, and so is not sufficient to cause instability in current climates. In warmer climates the positive water vapor feedback is thought to increase faster than the negative Planck feedback and so could aid in destabilising the system. Finally, the first term on right hand side of Eq. \ref{eq:lambda_general} is the planetary albedo feedback, which is due to clouds, surface albedo as well as absorption by the atmosphere foremost water vapor. It is left as an exercise to estimate the criterion for instability when considering planetary albedo feedback.

\section{Feedback mechanisms}
Above we calculated the feedback parameter for the general case (Eq. \ref{eq:lambda_general}) and identified three terms, one related to how planetary albedo changes with temperature, one related to how the effective emissivity changes and one which is directly related to the Planck feedback. Now, if we want to go about understanding and quantifying the feedback it is more convenient to make another division. For instance the planetary albedo is controlled by changes in surface albedo, cloudiness and water vapor, as well as some other factors such as aerosol particles and ozone that we shall ignore here as feedbacks. 
As a first step let us divide $\lambda$ into contributions due to changes in temperature, water vapor, clouds and surface albedo:
\begin{equation}
\lambda =  \lambda_T + \lambda_W + \lambda_C + \lambda_A + ...
\label{eq:lambda_linear_sum}
\end{equation}
where there are a number of additional terms due to interactions between e.g. clouds and water vapor changes as well as other factors that we have ignored. As long as we consider relatively small perturbations  then the interactions between feedbacks are of secondary importance. For large perturbations, however, it is easy to appreciate that this will no longer be the case. For instance at high latitudes cloudiness tends to increase in a warming climate, and so a decreasing surface albedo will have less of an impact on the energy imbalance than in a colder case. Or if the vertical temperature structure is substantially altered due to a rising tropopause, then the impacts of clouds and water vapor changes on the greenhouse effect may be different.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8 cm]{../illustrations/Planck_LR_feedback.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{ Principle of dividing temperature feedback into two contributions from Planck and Lapse-rate feedback. The shown temperature profile is typical of the tropics; at high latitudes the surface may warm faster than the troposphere. } 
\label{fig:planck_LR}
\end{figure}

It turns out to be meaningful to divide the temperature feedback parameter into two contributions (Figure \ref{fig:planck_LR}). The Planck feedback is that which would occur if the entire troposphere would warm at the rate of the surface temperature (gray shading). The lapse-rate feedback is that due to deviations from vertically uniform warming. In a later chapter we shall study stratospheric adjustment as a response to changing CO$_2$ which is not considered a feedback, and so ignoring the stratospheric temperature changes, we can write the temperature feedback as:
\begin{equation}
\lambda_T \approx \lambda_P + \lambda_{LR}.
\end{equation}
The planck feedback is therefore always negative, whereas the lapse-rate feedback could be either positive or negative: If the troposphere warms faster than the surface temperature then the system can radiate more to space relative to the case where warming was vertically uniform. This is the case in the tropics where the troposphere is vertically mixed by deep convective clouds (as in Figure \ref{fig:planck_LR}). At high latitudes, however, the surface may well warm faster than the troposphere such that the lapse-rate feedback is a positive feedback mechanism acting to amplify regional warming (Pithan and Mauritsen\cite{Pithan2014}). However, because the tropics cover a much larger area the lapse-rate feedback is thought to be on average negative.

It is worth noting that the division of feedback parameters chosen here is only one of many possible divisions, a few of which makes sense. A powerful recent development has been to include some of the water vapor feedback into the temperature feedback, namely that which would occur if relative humidity stayed fixed (Held and Shell\cite{Held2012}). This is effective since, as we shall argue next, changes in relative humidity tend to be small in climate models. 

Complex climate models agree broadly on the importance of these feedback mechanisms, although the strengths of feedback parameters are model dependent. Table \ref{table:feedbacks} shows a dozen examples from some of the models that participated in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). In particular the cloud feedback parameter varies substantially among models. An example of the spatial patterns of the feedback parameters is shown for one climate model in Figure \ref{fig:feedback_maps}. We see that the temperature feedbacks are the dominant negative feedback, whereas water vapor feedback is generally positive and strongest in the moist tropical regions. Surface albedo feedback is positive in regions were snow and sea ice melts. Finally, cloud feedbacks exhibit complex patterns which are different from model to model. Next we shall look at a some of the individual feedback mechanisms.

\begin{table}
  \caption{ Overview of feedback parameter strength (Wm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$) in some climate models as diagnosed using the radiative kernel method.

\subsection{Surface albedo feedback}
Perhaps the simplest feedback to comprehend is the surface albedo feedback. That is, at least the more important parts of the feedback that are related to melting snow and sea ice -- changes in vegetation may also impact the surface albedo -- and at least as long as we are thinking about a small warming relative to the present climate. In a later chapter we shall look at what happens if we instead cool the system and it might enter a snow-ball instability. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=12 cm]{../plots/CERES_Ebaf_shortwave.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{ Shortwave fluxes observed and inferred from the CERES dataset. Black is the downwelling annually averaged sunlight at the top of the atmosphere, on average 340 Wm$^{-2}$. The red line is the downwelling sunlight at the surface (187 Wm$^{-2}$), and the blue is the reflected sunlight at the surface (24 Wm$^{-2}$). Therefor the gray shaded area is the surface absorption. Over the region poleward of 60N the corresponding three numbers are 201, 102, 43 Wm$^{-2}$, respectively. } 
\label{fig:CERES_shortwave}
\end{figure}

So let us focus on the Arctic region, where most of the surface albedo feedback occurs with respect to warming (Figure \ref{fig:feedback_maps}). As a first attempt at constraining this feedback, let us assume there is no atmosphere and therefore also no clouds. Thus all incoming radiation arrives at the surface, and a fraction $A$ is reflected back to space. Suppose the surface albedo changes by an amount $\Delta A$ for a global warming of $\Delta T$ and let $S$ be the incoming solar radiation. Then regionally the imbalance changes by an amount $S \Delta A / \Delta T$. On average over the region poleward of 60N $S=201$ Wm$^{-2}$ (Figure \ref{fig:CERES_shortwave}). Complex climate models have that most of their Arctic sea ice is gone at a global mean temperature around 20$^\circ$C (currently about 15$^\circ$C), so $\Delta T \approx 5$ K. The observed average effective surface albedo in the region is 0.42 (Figure \ref{fig:CERES_shortwave}), which would then drop to about 0.07 which is that of an open ocean. The area of a spherical cap is $2\pi r^2 (1-\sin\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the Equator to the pole, whereas we recall the surface area of the whole Earth is $4\pi r^2$. Thus, suppose we consider the region poleward of 60N then that is little less than 7 percent of the Earth's surface; if we restrict this to mainly be the Arctic ocean roughly poleward of 70N then it is only 3 percent of the Earth. Then we can estimate an upper bound on the contribution of the Arctic region to global surface albedo feedback parameter as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\textrm{polar cap area}}{\textrm{global area}} \cdot \frac{\Delta A} {\Delta T} \cdot S \approx 1.0 \ \textrm{Wm}^{-2}\textrm{K}^{-1}.
\end{equation}
Now this is a gross overestimate. The reason is that the atmosphere, which we neglected above, hinders (absorbs or reflects) roughly half of the radiation at the top of the atmosphere from reaching the surface in the Arctic region. This alone would half the surface albedo feedback parameter. But the surface reflected sunlight would have to, once again traverse the atmosphere before escaping to space, whereby again about half the radiation would be either reflected back towards the surface or absorbed by the atmosphere. Accounting for this would leave us with a quarter of the original estimate, or roughly $\lambda_A \approx 0.25$ Wm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$ originating in the Arctic region only. Other regions, e.g. the Southern Ocean, also contribute to the surface albedo feedback making the climate model ensemble mean global $\lambda_A \approx 0.41$ Wm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$ seem plausible (Table \ref{table:feedbacks}). The calculation shows that in addition to how fast the regional surface albedo changes with global warming, perhaps the most important factor in determining the surface albedo feedbacks is the attenuation of sunlight by the atmosphere, which in turn is mostly dependent on cloudiness at these high latitudes.


\subsection{Water vapor feedback}
As we saw in the beginning of the course, water vapor is an excellent greenhouse gas in that it absorbs across a wide range of the infrared spectrum. A problem with water vapor is that, unlike CO$_2$, it is highly inhomogeneously distributed in the atmosphere both vertically, horizontally and in time; in Figure  \ref{fig:tropical_profiles} we saw how the average mixing ratio of water vapor in the tropics changes a factor 10.000 from the surface to the tropopause. This is because the lifetime of a water vapor molecule in the troposphere is relatively short, about a week or so, before it is for the most part precipitated out. The maximum amount of water vapor the atmosphere can hold before it starts condensing into cloud droplets is highly temperature dependent, roughly exponential according to the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=14 cm]{../external_figures/RH_change_echam-6_3_02p4_amip4K_zonalmean.png}
\end{center}
\caption{ Change in relative humidity in a model experiment where the ocean surface temperature is raised uniformly by 4 K.} 
\label{fig:RH_change_ECHAM}
\end{figure}

Fortunately, we can argue that relative humidity ($RH$) stays approximately constant under climate change. Relative humidity is the actual water vapor pressure ($e$) relative to the saturation vapor pressure ($e_s$). For the argument we will be making it is perhaps easier to think of the water vapor mixing ratio which is conserved with adiabatic motion ($q$, such that $RH \approx q/q_s$). If we trace an isolated air parcel along it's trajectory through the atmosphere we will find that it spends part of its time being saturated within clouds and part of its time being sub-saturated in clear air. As long as it is inside clouds it will have $q=q_s$, and so too at the exact moment the parcel leaves the cloud. Let us call this $q_s(T_c)$ where $T_c$ is the temperature at the last contact with cloud. Subsequently, in the cloud-free part of the parcels trajectory, where by necessity $T \ge T_c$, the water vapor mixing ratio at the last contact with cloud is conserved and so the relative humidity is $RH = q_s(T_c)/q_s(T) \le 1$. 

We can think of the total atmospheric circulation as consisting of many such trajectories of small parcels of air, each undergoing cloudy and cloud-free transects. Now, suppose the atmospheric circulation stays unchanged in a statistical sense under small amounts of climate change, then the only thing that changes for our parcels is the temperatures at which they operate. If then the entire troposphere warms at about the same rate, then for a given trajectory both $T_c$ and $T$ change by the same amount and so to first order $RH$ stays constant under climate change. To investigate how good an approximation this is, I plotted the change in $RH$ in Figure \ref{fig:RH_change_ECHAM} as the difference between two experiments: one with sea-surface temperatures prescribed as observed and one wherein I added a horizontally uniform warming of 4 K. In most of the troposphere the changes in $RH$ is less than or around 1 percent per Kelvin warming. In the tropopause and lower stratosphere region there is a substantial rise in $RH$, in part associated with a rise of the tropopause as discussed in the first chapter.

With this result at hand we can now estimate how the specific humidity changes with warming. Our starting point is the Clausius-Clapeyron relation for the saturation vapor pressure:
\[ \frac{de_s}{dT} = \frac{L}{R_v T^2} e_s, \]
which can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\ln e_s}{dT} = \frac{L}{R_v T^2},
\label{eq:clausius_clapeyron}
\end{equation}
such that the fractional rate of change of the saturation vapor pressure is a simple function of temperature. $L$ denotes the latent heat of evaporation (about $2.5 \cdot 10^6$ J kg$^{-1}$) and $R_v$ is the gas constant for water vapor (about $461$ J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$). Inserting different temperatures on the right hand side of Equation \ref{eq:clausius_clapeyron}, one finds that near the Earth's surface one finds increases of 6-8 percent per degree warming, and for tropical upper-tropospheric temperatures around 14 percent per degree warming. Since most of the water vapor resides in the lower troposphere the water vapor path scales with close to 7 percent per degree warming.

The reader is reminded that the infrared part of the water vapor feedback only works because the atmosphere is colder than the surface. Thus adding a water vapor molecule to the atmosphere near the surface is less effective than adding it near the tropopause, and so despite the amount of water vapor in the upper troposphere is much smaller than near the surface it still plays an important role in controlling the infrared radiation to space. The troposphere is colder than the surface in most places and at most times. 
An exception where the atmosphere can be warmer than the surface occurs at high latitudes in winter, and so there raising the emissivity of the atmosphere by adding water vapor will result in more infrared radiation escaping to space. 
A not negligible part of the water vapor feedback of about 20-30 percent, however, occurs because water vapor absorbs sunlight. This absorption depends less on where in the vertical the water vapor is, and more on the column integrated amount, the latitude and season, as well as the presence of clouds and the reflectivity of the surface.
It is left as an exercise to estimate the infrared part of the water vapor feedback under the assumption of constant relative humidity using the MODTRAN model and compare the result with that of more complex climate models.

\subsection{Cloud feedbacks}
Clouds are exceptionally complicated, and I would be foolish to even try to account for the many different ways in which clouds could possibly feed back on the Earth's energy balance. And not only are the mechanisms complex and difficult to grasp, they are also the main source of uncertainty in quantifying climate change and clouds impact the strength of other feedback mechanisms as we have seen above in the example of surface albedo feedback. Therefore, cloud feedbacks are very much central to the part of climate sciences that aims at estimating Earth's climate sensitivity. Because it is so complicated, one current trend is to dissect the cloud feedback into separate regimes (Figure \ref{fig:cloud_feedback_illustration}) wherein the hope is that the individual mechanisms can be understood and quantified. It is not at all clear that this is the most effective way to achieve overall progress, though, and climate scientists also pursue other routes to determining feedback. 
Current thinking is that it is useful to divide cloud feedback into three groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mid- to high latitude mixed-phase clouds
\item Low-level clouds 
\item Deep clouds,
\end{itemize}
although one could certainly think of other divisions that would be meaningful. The first two categories act mostly in the shortwave bands by regulating the planetary albedo, whereas the third category is thought to mainly function in the longwave by regulating the infrared radiation emitted to space.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=17 cm]{../illustrations/Cloud_feedbacks_illustration.png}
\end{center}
\caption{ Illustration of various cloud feedback mechanisms. To the left is mixed-phase cloud feedback occurring at mid- to high latitudes in for instance frontal clouds, in the lower middle I show several mechanisms related to low-level stratocumulus and trade-wind cumulus cloud feedbacks, and to the right are deep cloud feedbacks which are thought to act mainly by regulating the infrared radiation escaping to space. } 
\label{fig:cloud_feedback_illustration}
\end{figure}

Ice clouds are generally less reflective to sunlight than are liquid clouds. This is primarily because ice crystals tend to be few and large, whereas cloud droplets tend to be small but many: the cross-section of many small droplets is larger for a given amount of condensate. In a warming climate the isotherms will move upward in the atmosphere and poleward alone resulting in a larger fraction of liquid clouds (Figure \ref{fig:cloud_feedback_illustration}), and so a negative shortwave cloud feedback must result. 
If all clouds at temperatures below the melting point (0$^\circ$C), then a very strong negative feedback would result. However, it is a bit more complicated. At temperatures above 0$^\circ$C all clouds consist of the liquid phase, and below about -35$^\circ$C all clouds consist of ice phase. Between these temperatures both phases can exist, we say clouds are of mixed phase. The more one can maintain liquid clouds at temperatures below the melting point, the weaker the mixed-phase feedback is as there is simply less ice clouds that can be transformed.
Signs of what might be dominating negative mixed-phase cloud feedback can be seen in the Southern Ocean, North Pacific and the Arctic in the MPI-ESM-LR model (Figure \ref{fig:feedback_maps}). This is not the only type of cloud feedback in those regions though, and for instance total cloud feedback appears to be positive in the North Atlantic, a region where we would also expect mixed-phase cloud feedback to be active. A couple of recent studies try to observationally constrain mixed-phase feedback. One study finds that complex climate models are on average correct, with some models having stronger and some models having weaker feedback. Another study finds that models as a whole overestimate the strength of the negative mixed-phase cloud feedback.

Low-level clouds in the tropics and sub-tropics on the contrary consist mostly of liquid droplets. They are, nevertheless, consistently identified as the main source of spread in complex climate model feedback, which is likely due to there being a large number of competing mechanisms (Figure \ref{fig:cloud_feedback_illustration}), explaining all of which I couldn't possibly do any justice here. Foremost, the low-level clouds may regulate the planetary albedo either by changing their coverage or by changing their reflectivity. The reflectivity of low-level clouds is mainly controlled by the amount of condensate. We saw previously that in a warmer climate the atmosphere holds more water vapor, as of Clausius-Clapeyron, and so a naive expectation is that low-level clouds will thicken as there is more vapor to condense (adiabatic thickening). Counteracting this, is the mixing of the moist lower atmospheric air with dry air subsiding from aloft: in a warmer climate the difference in specific humidity will be larger between the boundary layer and the subsiding air, and so the mixing down of air (entrainment) results in a larger depression of relative humidity and fewer clouds in a warmer climate. The strength of the mixing, in turn, is controlled by the strength of the temperature inversion above the boundary layer. In some regions of the sub-tropics this inversion is expected to strengthen in a warmer climate resulting in more cloudiness. Overall, complex climate models can exhibit both positive and negative low-level cloud feedbacks, but there is a tendency for observational and fine-scale cloud modeling evidence to favor positive feedback from this regime.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10 cm]{../illustrations/Deep_cloud_feedback_illustration.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{ Illustration of the infrared feedback from deep clouds. The upper level clouds are thought to move upward in a warming climate so as to maintain a nearly constant temperature of about 200 K, alone resulting in the positive fixed-anvil temperature feedback. There may also be changes in the anvil coverage, something which is popularly denoted iris-effect. } 
\label{fig:deep_cloud_feedback_illustration}
\end{figure}

Deep cloud feedbacks originate for the most part in the tropical regions. We argued in an earlier chapter that the tropopause might move upward in a warming climate so as to maintain an approximately constant temperature, and with it, presumably also that of the deepest convective cloud tops (anvils). 
To see how this ascendence of upper level clouds might exert a cloud feedback, let us consider the gray body case with an upper-level cloud that covers a fraction, $f$, which acts as an ideal black body. The cloud is assumed to rise such as to maintain a constant temperature with a warming surface ($dT_a/dT_s=0$, Figure \ref{fig:deep_cloud_feedback_illustration}). Since there is only one unknown in our problem, $T_s$, we also only need to form one energy balance equation; we choose the top of the atmosphere:
\begin{equation}
N = \frac{S_o}{4}(1-\alpha) - (1-f) \epsilon \sigma T_s^4 - f\sigma T_a^4.
\label{eq:anvil_balance}
\end{equation}
First, let us assume that $f$ is constant such that the upper level cloud maintains its coverage, then we can calculate the feedback parameter:
\begin{equation}
\lambda =  - 4(1-f) \epsilon \sigma T_s^3,
\end{equation}
where we note that $dT_a/dT_s=0$. Comparing to the Planck feedback parameter, Equation(\ref{eq:lambda_planck}), we immediately recognize that this can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
\lambda =  \lambda_P + f 4 \epsilon \sigma T_s^3,
\end{equation}
where the second term is then the fixed anvil temperature (FAT) feedback parameter. Notice how the actual temperature of the cloud, $T_a$, plays no role in determining the strength of the feedback. Since the FAT feedback parameter equals $-f\lambda_P$ we can readily estimate what $f$ has to be around 0.11 to provide the longwave cloud feedback parameter found in complex climate models ($\lambda_{C,LW}$, Table \ref{table:feedbacks}). The estimate of $f$ is smaller than expected since tropical upper-level cirrus clouds cover a larger fraction of the Earth, perhaps twice as much. However, because they consist of few relatively large ice crystal their longwave emissivity is usually less than unity and so in this more realistic setting it requires a larger coverage to reach the same amount of feedback.

Now, let the area $f$ covered with our upper-level black body cloud vary with temperature to emulate an iris-effect. Now the derivative with respect to $T_s$ of Equation (\ref{eq:anvil_balance}) becomes a bit more complicated:
\begin{eqnarray}
\lambda &=&  \lambda_P + f 4 \epsilon \sigma T_s^3 + \epsilon \sigma T_s^4\frac{df}{dT_s} - \sigma T_a^4\frac{df}{dT_s} \nonumber \\
&=&  \lambda_P + \lambda_{FAT} +  \sigma \left( \epsilon T_s^4 - T_a^4\right)\frac{df}{dT_s},
\label{eq:lambda_iris}
\end{eqnarray}
where we recognize the second term as the FAT feedback parameter. The third term represents a replacement of radiation originating from the upper-level cloud to radiation originating from the surface if $df/dT_s$ is negative. In this extreme example it takes only a 2 percent per degree warming reduction of the anvil coverage ($df/dT_s \approx -0.02f$) for the iris-effect feedback parameter to be as strong as  $\lambda_{FAT}$. This is an underestimate of the amount of reduction required for several reasons. First, if cloud cover decreases then the planetary albedo also decreases, thereby inducing a compensating positive shortwave cloud feedback. Second, most of the upper-level cirrus cloud is optically too thin to act as ideal black bodies, further requiring a larger reduction. Together, I believe it might take around 5 percent reduction per degree warming, or so, to be able to compensate the positive FAT feedback.
Complex climate models exhibit no, or only very weak, reductions of anvil area with warming, whereas different lines of observational evidence suggest that models underestimate this reduction. The interpretation of the data, however, remains contentious and it is also currently not known mechanistically why anvil coverage would reduce substantially in a warming climate.

% Use this to argue that $f$ is larger because the local \epsilon is much smaller in the deep tropics were convective cloud feedbacks act

\section{Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS)}
So far we have been agnostic as to why the climate system might be out of balance. It could be due to some random fluctuation, a short volcanic eruption, a change in the solar constant, or forced by a change in the atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration. We shall return to radiative forcing in more detail later, but a standard way to define the sensitivity of the climate system is to expose it to a doubling of CO$_2$ relative to the pre-industrial level which reduces the infrared radiation to space and yields a top-of-atmosphere imbalance of:
$$F_{2x} \approx 3.7 \ \textrm{Wm}^{-2}.$$
A neat thing about CO$_2$ is that the atmosphere is optically thick in the part of the spectrum dominated by CO$_2$ absorption. This leads to the forcing being almost logarithmic in the concentration so that each doubling (from 1 to 2xCO$_2$, from 2 to 4xCO$_2$ etc.) results in about the same amount of forcing. If we think $F_{2x}$ is a sufficiently small perturbation that the feedback parameter, $\lambda$, can be considered constant then we can write the energy balance equation as:
\begin{equation}
N = F_{2x} + \lambda \Delta T
\end{equation}
where we have linearized around a base state. Imagine that we instantaneously double the CO$_2$ concentration in the atmosphere. At this very moment we have $N=F_{2x}$ and the system will start warming. With the warming ($\Delta T > 0$) feedbacks start acting. If the system is stable ($\lambda < 0$) then the warming will lead to a reduction in the planetary imbalance ($N$). It is quite popular to think of this system as an electric feedback loop circuit (Figure \ref{fig:feedback_illustration}). 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=9 cm]{../illustrations/Feedback_illustration.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{ Illustration of the principle of climate change feedback to external forcing $F$. In case a) the feedback is the product of the total feedback parameter, $\lambda$, and the temperature change. In case b) I divide this into a linear sum corresponding to equation \ref{eq:lambda_linear_sum}, whereby for instance the symbol is $T=\lambda_T \Delta T$. } 
\label{fig:feedback_illustration}
\end{figure}

Eventually, after some time, our system may reach a new equilibrium where $N=0$. Here the temperature change, which we call the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is:
\begin{equation}
\textrm{ECS} = \frac{-F_{2x}}{\lambda}.
\end{equation}
The inverse relationship between the total feedback parameter ($\lambda$) and ECS is plotted as the black curve in Figure \ref{fig:feedback_vs_ECS} along with estimates from complex climate models. All models exhibit higher sensitivity than what would be the case if there would only be Planck feedback (dashed line). The scatter of models around the theoretical line can have several causes, for instance $F_{2x}$ is model-dependent and there may be non-linearities impacting the estimates. Nevertheless, most of the spread in ECS is due to spread in the total feedback parameter. It is left as an exercise to explore how uncertainty in the strength of feedback mechanisms impact ECS.

\chapter{Temporal evolution}
\label{chapter:evolution}
In the previous chapter we focussed on the stability of stationary states and the equilibrium response to a small forcing. Here we will investigate how the system approaches these equilibria and how it responds to forcing. This involves considerations of the relevant heat reservoirs, and ignorance of those that do not matter. On this background we will develop a mixed-layer and a two-layer model and study their behavior. 

\section{Heat capacities}
When we think of the Earth's climate system there are several components that can absorb energy with different heat capacities and with different timescales involved. Usually we think of the oceans as the largest component followed by the atmosphere and cryosphere. There are, however, parts of these components that are closely connected to the surface temperature, and there are parts that are weakly connected to the surface. This means, foremost, that it is meaningful to divide the oceans into two or more parts.

If we start with the atmosphere, we saw in the first chapter how the troposphere is for the most part quickly stirred, mixed or overturned by various motion. Therefore it does not take very long for air to be mixed around the world, roughly on the order of months, though the time it takes to cross the equator can be longer. The stratosphere in turn, we found was in radiative equilibrium and stable stratified; though it isn't motionless. There are quite strong zonal winds, and also there is an overturning circulation called the Brewer-Dobson circulation. The latter starts at the tropical tropopause with upward motion, goes up, poleward and terminates in the high latitudes. It takes, however, on the order of five years. The atmosphere weighs in at nearly 10.000 kg m$^{-2}$, which corresponds to the hydrostatic surface pressure of 98.500 Pa, or about that of a column of 10 meters of liquid water. The specific heat capacity of air is, however, a factor four less than for water (Table \ref{table:capacity}) and so in terms of total heat capacity the atmosphere is equivalent to 2.5 meters of water per unit area. The troposphere is close to 90 percent of the atmospheric mass, and so it is reasonable to disregard the upper atmosphere here. 

There is only a tiny fraction of water vapor in the atmosphere, about 25 kg m$^{-2}$, which corresponds to 2.5 cm if it was all condensed and distributed onto the surface. But the energy it takes to evaporate a kilogram of water is substantial, $L \approx $  2.500.000 J kg$^{-1}$. In the previous chapter we learned that relative humidity stays roughly constant under climate change and that this results in roughly a 7 percent increase in specific humidity per degree warming. Converting this latent heat into an equivalent heat capacity we find that the energy storage due to evaporation of water vapor corresponds to about 1.0 meters of water per unit area.

The oceans are on average about 4 km deep and cover about 70 percent of the earth's surface -- a massive heat reservoir compared to the equivalent heat capacities for the atmosphere derived above. However, only the uppermost part of it called the mixed-layer is in immediate contact with the surface. The layer is mixed by turbulent motion mostly caused by atmospheric winds exerting stress at the ocean surface and is typically 50-100 meters deep. Thus, this mixed-layer alone is much larger than the atmospheric heat capacity which we estimated above to be approximately the equivalent of 2.5 plus 1.0 m of water. The rest of the ocean mixes more slowly and it is thought that a full overturning of the ocean will take several millennia. The slow mixing into the deeper oceans happens across a continuum of scales, first into the thermocline ($\approx$ 500 m) and then into the deep ocean via complex circulations. For the purpose of this course, however, we shall model the heat capacity of the mixed-layer (plus atmosphere) and deep oceans as only two separate components. 

The cryosphere can be considered a kind of (anti) heat reservoir. Just opposite to water vapor in the atmosphere, which is a higher energetic state than liquid water, ice is a lower energetic state: melting ice requires energy and it takes about 338.000 J kg$^{-1}$. The cryosphere on Earth is dominated by the two large ice-sheets in Antarctica ($26\cdot10^6$ km$^3$) and Greenland ($2.8\cdot10^6$ km$^3$), whereas for comparison the Arctic sea ice is two to three orders of magnitude less abundant ($20\cdot10^3$ km$^3$). But where sea ice responds relatively quickly to the surface temperature with a timescale of a few years, the ice sheets can take several millennia to adjust to a new climate. The time it would take for glaciers to melt is uncertain, but for the considerations here we can safely neglect the cryosphere.

But how about the Earth's soils and crust? There is substantially more mass there than in any of the above compartments. Well, fluctuations in surface temperature do propagate downward in the soils and rock, albeit at a very slow rate. Under typical conditions it takes 100 years for a perturbation at the surface to be felt at all at 150 m depth, and a 1.000 years to reach 500 m depth; a fact that one can use to reconstruct temperatures in past centuries by measuring temperatures in boreholes. This propagation is so slow because the thermal conductivity of soils and bedrock is low compared to that of a moving fluid or gas, typically by many orders of magnitude. Therefore, even though the soil and crust have similar specific heat capacities to air (Table \ref{table:capacity}) and represent an enormous mass, it plays only a minor role in determining the flows of energy in the Earth system; one that we shall neglect here.

\end{table}

It is upon this rather elaborate background that we shall treat the heat capacities of the Earth in the following as consisting of two components: 1) the troposphere plus ocean mixed-layer as representative of the global mean surface temperature ($T$), and 2) the deep oceans with a separate temperature ($T_d$). This turns out to be a surprisingly good approximation to much more complicated climate models.


\section{The mixed-layer model}
Let us first assume the simplest case where the whole system is represented by a single heat capacity, $C$. We may here think of the uppermost part of the ocean and the atmosphere; a model we refer to as the mixed-layer model simply because as of the above argumentation the upper ocean heat capacity is at least an order of magnitude larger than the rest. The mixed-layer model is the basis for our further considerations and the concept is widely used. In the mixed-layer case with a single heat capacity the imbalance results in a temperature change, such that:
\begin{equation}
N = C\frac{dT}{dt}. 
\label{eq:mlo_imbalance}
\end{equation}
We can next assume small perturbations around some stationary state, $T_o$, such that $T$ is no longer the absolute temperature but rather the temperature relative to $T_o$:
\begin{equation}
C\frac{dT}{dt} = F + \lambda T,
\label{eq:mlo}
\end{equation}
where $F$ is some external forcing. 

Let us first consider a system at a stationary state, whereat at time $t=0$ we abruptly apply a constant forcing $F$, forever. We can realize that this is a solution to the differential equation:
\begin{equation}
T(t) = \frac{-F}{\lambda}\left(1-e^{\frac{\lambda}{C}t}\right),
\label{eq:mlo_solution}
\end{equation}
which can be verified by inserting equation \ref{eq:mlo_solution} into equation \ref{eq:mlo}. We readily recognize the equilibrium response by inserting $t=\infty$ such that the expression in parentheses is unity:
\begin{equation}
T(\infty)=\frac{-F}{\lambda},
\label{eq:mlo_equilibrium}
\end{equation}
which clearly reminds us of the special case for a doubling of CO$_2$, $ECS=-F_{2x}/\lambda$, developed in an earlier chapter. It is perhaps worth noting here that the equilibrium response is not dependent on how one got there since there is only one unique solution as long as $\lambda < 0$ everywhere. In deriving our solution we assumed that the full forcing was applied instantaneously and held constant forever, but we could also imagine ramping up (or down) forcing over a finite period of time and then holding it constant; the end result will be the same.

\begin{figure}

\end{center}
\caption{ Numerical solutions to equation \ref{eq:mlo} to an abrupt forcing of $F_{2x}$ with varying values of $ECS$ of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 K. The heat capacity is chosen to correspond to that of an ocean covering 70 percent of the surface with a depth of 75 m which is a typical equivalent depth found in complex climate models. The dashed line shows the initial slope and the dots shows the e-folding response at time $\tau$. } 
\label{fig:mlo_plot}
\end{figure}

Next, let us look at the temporal behavior of the mixed-layer ocean. First, let us look at the initial warming rate of the system by evaluating the time-derivative of our solution at time $t=0$:
$$\frac{dT}{dt}\Bigr|_{t=0} = \frac{F}{C},$$
which is simply the rate of energy input ($F$) divided by the heat capacity. The initial slope is completely independent of the feedback parameter, and hence the climate sensitivity, of our model. To demonstrate this, I plot solutions with widely varying $\lambda$ in Figure \ref{fig:mlo_plot} and the analytical initial slope. It turns out that in the first few years the actual solution stays close to the initial slope and only after some time do climate change feedbacks begin to affect the solution. This has important consequences for attempts to estimate Earth's climate sensitivity from short term forcing from volcanoes.

For intermediate time-scales we may consider the time it takes to obtain some fraction of the equilibrium response. Here it is common to define the e-folding time as the time it takes for the response to reach $1-e^{-1}$, or roughly two thirds, of the equilibrium ($e\approx 2.718$). Remembering that $\lambda<0$ to obtain stable solutions, we may define the response time:
$$\tau \equiv \frac{-C}{\lambda}$$
which depends on the heat capacity and the feedback parameter, and not the forcing. Inserting this into equation \ref{eq:mlo_solution}, and substitute in equation \ref{eq:mlo_equilibrium}, we obtain a different form of the solution:
$$T(t) = T(\infty)\left(1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}\right)$$ 
such that when $t=\tau$ the system has reached a fraction $1-e^{-1}$ of the equilibrium. From this we can readily realize that the more sensitive the system is, the longer it takes to reach equilibrium. In Figure  \ref{fig:mlo_plot} I plotted the response time which increase from roughly 2 to 10 years for $ECS$ from 1 to 5 K. The slower equilibration of the more sensitive models is readily visible: after about 10 years the low sensitivity models have practically reached equilibrium, but the high sensitivity models continue to warm.

Another interesting type of forcing is an fast injection or release of energy. We might think of the forcing as represented by  Dirac's delta function, but the main point is that it should be active only for a short period of time compared to the response time of the system. A volcanic eruption could be considered such a case with reasonable approximation. Whatever the reason, though, the result is that at time $t=0$ we might find the system out of equilibrium such that $T(0) \ne 0$ and subsequently we can set $F=0$. The solution to this is, as was also the case for the abrupt forcing, an exponential function:
\begin{equation}
T(t)=T(0)\cdot e^{\frac{\lambda}{C}t},
\end{equation}
but where we previously started with $T(0)=0$ we now have the system approaching the equilibrium state $T(\infty)=0$. Notice how for the mixed-layer ocean that the e-folding time, $\tau$, to a delta forcing is the same as for the abrupt forcing.


% Include a case of a delta-forcing? 
% T(t)=T(0)*e{\frac{\lambda}{C}t}

\subsection{Numerical solutions}
The mixed-layer model can be readily solved analytically for the case of an abrupt forcing and doing so has several advantages. But as we add complexity to our model and might want to consider forcing that varies in time the analytical solution quickly becomes intractable. Therefore we shall often resort to a numerical solution. The equations we want to solve are generally quite simple such that a basic time-stepping method can be used. We can approximate:
$$ \frac{dT}{dt} \approx \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta t}, $$
where the large $\Delta$ indicate finite changes in temperature and time, rather than infinitesimal, such that we might think of $\Delta T = T(t+\Delta t)-T(t)$. Inserting this into equation \ref{eq:mlo} and rearranging:
\begin{equation}
T(t+\Delta t) = T(t) + \frac{\Delta t}{C} \left[F(t)+\lambda \cdot T(t)\right], 
\label{eq:numerical_solution}
\end{equation}
where we have defined the right hand side of equation \ref{eq:mlo} to be evaluated at time $t$, and the forcing to be a function of time. The equation can then be solved by stepping forward in a time-loop. To yield sufficiently accurate results we need to make small enough time steps: for our purposes we will be making monthly steps.  It is left as an exercise to test this approximation.
In Python the time integration can be programmed as a for-loop and might look something like this:
\begin{verbatim}
   for t in range(0,nstep-1):
        T_ml[t+1] = T_ml[t] + delta_time/C_ml*(forcing[t]+lambda_0*T_ml[t])
        imbalance[t+1] = C_ml*(T_ml[t+1]-T_ml[t])/delta_time
\end{verbatim}
where we recognize the terms in equations \ref{eq:mlo_imbalance} and \ref{eq:numerical_solution}. The code can readily be extended to solving more complex differential equations that we shall derive later.

Although we shall not use the following methodology during this course, for completeness  of presentation I want to mention that there is  very elegant way to solve the evolution of a climate system to a time-varying forcing. Here it is assumed that a general evolving forcing $F(t)$ can be considered to consist of an additive sequence of many small abrupt forcings, or 'steps'. If, for instance, the surface temperature response to forcing $F_{2x}$ from a doubling if CO$_2$ is $R(t)$ (see Figure \ref{fig:mlo_plot}) then we can estimate the surface temperature evolution as a sum of the response to all previous steps up until the time $t$:
$$ T(t) \approx \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \frac{R(t-i)}{F_{2x}}\cdot \left[F(i)-F(i-1)\right], $$
where the quantity in brackets is the incremental forcing change. The step-response method is particularly useful in that the response function $R$ can also be derived from complex climate models by conducting a single abrupt forcing experiment. Further, one can think of the response function in more general terms to mean anything that varies in time after an abrupt forcing is applied such as local temperature, or even the hydrological cycle, so that we are not limited to think of the global mean surface temperature.


\section{The two-layer model}
Although the mixed-layer model is attractive in its simplicity, for the timescales we are interested in however, the vast heat capacity of the deep ocean plays an important role. We may readily extend the mixed-layer model to a two-layer model by adding an additional heat reservoir of the deep ocean, $C_d$. The imbalance of the system can then be calculated as the sum of the rate of change of heat in the two reservoirs:
\begin{equation}
N = C\frac{dT}{dt} + C_d\frac{dT_d}{dt}, 
\label{eq:twolayer-imbalance}
\end{equation}
where $T_d$ is the deep ocean temperature. The deep ocean is not in direct contact with the surface and so does neither feel directly the atmospheric feedbacks nor the radiative forcing. It is connected to the mixed-layer by diffusive and/or advective processes such that at some set of states $(T, T_d)$ the net flux is zero; we shall take these to be $T=T_d$. Note that the temperature of the real world deep ocean ($\approx 3^\circ$C) is colder than that of the surface because deep water formation occurs primarily in polar regions; the temperatures in the two-layer model $(T, T_d)$ are to be thought of as relative. We shall further assume the flux is proportional to the difference, such that:
\begin{equation}
C_d\frac{dT_d}{dt} = \gamma(T-T_d), 
\label{eq:twolayer-deep}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is the deep ocean heat uptake efficiency which has values on the order of 1 Wm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$. Whenever the mixed-layer is warmer than the deep ocean heat will flow to reduce the difference and vice-versa. In order to conserve energy, i.e. satisfy equation \ref{eq:twolayer-imbalance}, we must amend the mixed-layer by subtracting the flux into the deep ocean:
\begin{equation}
C\frac{dT}{dt} = F + \lambda T - \gamma(T-T_d).
\label{eq:twolayer-ml}
\end{equation}
The resulting set of coupled differential equations \ref{eq:twolayer-deep} and \ref{eq:twolayer-ml} is the two-layer model. It is helpful to realize that if you insert \ref{eq:twolayer-deep} and \ref{eq:twolayer-ml} into equation \ref{eq:twolayer-imbalance} you get:
$$N = F + \lambda T,$$
that is, the imbalance of the two-layer model is determined solely by the mixed-layer temperature and the external forcing. The deep ocean is only 'felt' at the top-of-the-atmosphere through the moderation of the mixed-layer temperature. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=17 cm]{../plots/Two_layer_temperature_abrupt_forcing.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{ Numerical solutions to the two-layer model (blue) equations \ref{eq:twolayer-deep} and \ref{eq:twolayer-ml} to an abrupt doubling of CO$_2$ with an $ECS$ of 2.77 K. Light blue dots are results from MPI-ESM1.2 which has the same ECS. Shown in black is the mixed-layer model, and the gray dashed line is the initial slope. } 
\label{fig:two_layer_plot}
\end{figure}

Let us first look at the behavior of the two-layer model starting at rest with $T=T_d=0$ and we apply an abrupt forcing, $F$, at time $t=0$ and then keep it constant forever. Since the imbalance is only determined by the mixed-layer temperature only, we immediately obtain that the longterm equilibrium response is the same as before:
$$ T(\infty)=\frac{-F}{\lambda}.$$
Likewise, the initial warming rate is determined only by the heat capacity of the mixed-layer, since at time $t=0$ the ocean heat uptake into the deep ocean is zero:
$$\frac{dT}{dt}\Bigr|_{t=0} = \frac{F}{C}.$$
Thus, when exerted to an abrupt forcing both the longterm response and the initial slope is the shared between the mixed-layer and two-layer models.

It is when we consider the intermediate timescales of decades to centuries that the mixed-layer and two-layer models behave differently. For the mixed-layer model we were able to derive an exact analytical solution and saw that it behaves as an exponential relaxation towards the equilibrium. It is also possible to derive an exact analytical solutions to the two-layer model, as shown for instance by Geoffroy et al.\cite{geoffroy2013a}, but this is far too complicated for this course and further obtaining the exact solution provides little physical insight. In broad terms, though, we can think of the deep ocean as introducing a slow time-scale, $\tau_d$ which is of the order of centuries, such that the solution is approximately the weighted sum of two exponentials $T(t) \approx \frac{-F}{\lambda}(1-a e^{\frac{-t}{\tau}}-b e^{\frac{-t}{\tau_d}})$, where $a+b=1$. 

Instead, I solved the two-layer model numerically as shown in Figure \ref{fig:two_layer_plot} where I also compare it to the mixed-layer model and the results from a complex climate model, MPI-ESM1.2. We see that the overall behavior of MPI-ESM1.2 is captured well by the two-layer model; a fact that makes the two-layer model a particularly useful starting point for studies of climate dynamics. There are two small differences, though: in the first few years MPI-ESM1.2 warms faster most likely because it also includes some land which has a low heat capacity, and in the long run the warming in MPI-ESM1.2 is a bit slower. The latter may be due to non-linearities in the model's feedback, a theme we shall return to later.

A caveat with the two-layer model is that the single deep-ocean temperature is to represent diverse set of mixing- and advective processes that constitute the Earth's deep ocean circulation. Therefore, to get a reasonable match of the two-layer model to more complex models, such as MPI-ESM1.2, we have to use a somewhat smaller heat capacity than that of the full deep ocean of about 4.000 m depth. Instead, I use a fraction of that, 1.000 m equivalent, to compromise between relatively fast mixing into the upper deep ocean and slow mixing deeper down. One can model this with more levels, or a full three dimensional general ocean circulation model, but this comes at the expense of transparency.

Finally, let us take a look at the temperature response of the two-layer model to a delta forcing. Here we imagine that heat is rapidly extracted from- or injected into the mixed-layer such that the deep ocean cannot react, that is, at time $t=0$ we have  $T\ne 0$ and $T_d=0$. If we then evaluate the initial rate of change of the mixed-layer temperature (\ref{eq:twolayer-ml}) then we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dT}{dt}\Bigr|_{t=0} = \frac{T(0)}{C}\left[\lambda - \gamma\right],
\end{equation}
yielding the result that the deep ocean heat uptake acts to restore the surface temperature faster towards it's original state. Remember that $\lambda$ is likely somewhere in the range -1 to -2 Wm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$, and so the effect of $\gamma$ is to nearly double the restoration rate relative to that of the mixed-layer model: if the delta forcing was for instance due to a volcanic eruption that lead to a cooling of the mixed-layer, then the deep ocean will transfer heat towards the surface thereby warming the mixed-layer up again. It is left as exercises to explore this case.

\end{center}
\caption{ Comparison of the two-layer model (solid curves) to the zero-layer model (dashed lines).

\label{fig:zero_layer_plot}
\end{figure}

\section{The zero-layer model}
An approximate diagnostic version of the two-layer model can be obtained for the case of a gradually changing forcing. We will use the fact that the mixed-layer and the deep ocean heat capacities are distinctly different by more than an order of magnitude. Thus, there must be some intermediate timescales that are long enough so that the mixed-layer heat capacity can be ignored ($C\rightarrow 0$) and still short enough that the deep ocean warming can be ignored ($C_d \rightarrow \infty$). In this limit, the two-layer model surface temperature (equation \ref{eq:twolayer-ml}) simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
0 = F + \left(\lambda - \gamma \right)T,
\label{eq:zero-layer}
\end{equation}
and from equations \ref{eq:twolayer-imbalance} and \ref{eq:twolayer-deep} we get $N=\gamma T$. Thus, for instance the evolution of the surface temperature is purely a function of the forcing:
$$T(t)=\frac{F(t)}{\gamma-\lambda}.$$
We call this the zero-layer approximation as there are no layers left that have memory and the result is a purely diagnostic equation relating temperature, forcing and imbalance with bulk properties of the system. I plotted both the zero- and the two-layer models exposed to forcing that increases linearly in time in Figure \ref{fig:zero_layer_plot}. We usually think of experiments with, say, a 1 percent increase in atmospheric CO$_2$ per year, yielding a doubling of the concentration in about 70 years -- this corresponds roughly to the anthropogenic forcing increase since the 1950's. The temperature response after 70 years in this experiment is often referred to as the transient climate response (TCR). Because the forcing is logarithmic in the CO$_2$ concentration this corresponds to a nearly linear increase in time. The zero-layer approximation works surprisingly well on multi-decadal timescales for these types of forcing that changes gradually. In the first decades the zero-layer model overestimates warming as the mixed-layer heat capacity still matters, whereas after about 50-60 years the model underestimates surface warming as the deep ocean begins to warm up. Further, the faster we increase the forcing the more the zero-layer model overestimates the initial warming.
The zero-layer model is being extensively used to interpret the instrumental record warming in terms of inferring Earth's climate sensitivity; a theme that we shall return to later.

Imagine the Earth is hit by an asteroid. The impact whirls debris into the atmosphere which results in a temporary rise of the planetary albedo and hence a surface cooling. The debris is relatively heavy and therefore falls out of the atmosphere within weeks of the impact such that we can consider the asteroid impact a delta forcing. The rapid cooling leaves the system shortly after the impact at $T(0)=-6.0$ K. We shall assume the Earth has an $ECS=3.0$ K and a mixed-layer heat capacity of corresponding to a depth of 75 meters: $C= 0.7 \cdot 75\cdot 1000 \cdot 4181$ J m$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$. 
If you ignore the deep ocean, how many years would it take until the mixed-layer temperature reaches $T=-1.0$ K?

\chapter{External forcing and fast adjustments}
\label{chapter:forcing}
The climate system can be forced in a number of ways, and previously we have taken the concept of external forcing from a doubling of atmospheric CO$_2$ for granted. But what we mean by external forcing is not always obvious. The first thing we need to do is to define the system we are looking at. Often we think of the physical properties of the system: the temperature, humidity, clouds and surface albedo, whereas other components such as the solar constant or the atmospheric CO$_2$ are considered as "given" external boundary conditions. Feedbacks are then those internal processes within the system that respond to changes in the external boundary conditions in ways that achieves a new balanced climate. 

But even some of those internal processes may not respond in concert with the surface temperature: we have already looked at the sluggish deep ocean in the previous chapter, but also ice sheets may take millennia to equilibrate with a new climate, and vegetation may react to changes in boundary conditions such as CO$_2$ or sunlight over long timescales. In a later chapter we shall develop a way to handle the possible impact of the slow deep ocean adjustment process as a time-dependent feedback. 
Also at short timescales -- and this is what we shall investigate here -- things can change in ways that do not depend directly on the temperature. We shall see below how the stratosphere cools off rapidly, within weeks, after an increase in CO$_2$ which is a consequence of the increased emissivity allowing it to cool more effectively. But also clouds may respond to atmospheric composition changes, actually within hours, well before the surface temperature has had time to respond.

\vspace{0.5 cm}
\noindent
When trying to separate {\bf feedback} from {\bf forcing} I find it useful to think of the responses that impact the radiation balance as to whether, or not, they depend physically on the surface temperature. The increase in water vapor depends mostly on the surface temperature, hence it is a feedback, but in other cases it may not be so straightforward. Therefore we often resort to a more ad-hoc definition by dividing the problem into time-scales. We call things that happen well within the first year after a forcing is applied {\bf fast adjustments} and those that happen in congruence with surface temperature we define as {\bf feedbacks}. Finally, those that involve long timescales are often referred to as slow- or time-dependent feedbacks. It is often quite challenging to separate these effects. 
%A clear short-coming of this division occurs for vegetation which may respond to purely the CO$_2$ fertilization, but over long timescales. 

\vspace{0.5 cm}
\noindent
To be a little more concrete, let's take the perhaps simplest case of an abrupt but small change in the solar constant, $\delta S_o$. We may now perturb our energy balance equation \ref{eq:black_body_energy_balance} for the black body Earth and assume the planetary albedo stays constant:
$$ N+\delta N \approx \frac{S_o+\delta S_o}{4}(1-\alpha) - \sigma (T_e+\delta T)^4 $$
Now, the system was in balance before the abrupt change, so $N=0$ and initially $\delta T=0$, such that we can estimate the change in the radiation balance induced by the change in solar constant:
$$ \delta N(t=0) \approx \frac{\delta S_o}{4}(1-\alpha).$$
We can think of this initial change in the radiation balance as the forcing, $F$. Traditionally, climate modelers apply a 2 percent increase in the solar constant, giving $F_{2pct}\approx 4.8$ Wm$^{-2}$ which is close to that of a doubling of CO$_2$, $F_{2x}\approx 3.7$ Wm$^{-2}$. 

We may, however, imagine things could happen on a short timescale that are not congruent with the surface temperature response to the solar forcing. The first is that some of the extra sunlight will be absorbed by ozone in the stratosphere, and because the stratosphere has a low heat capacity and is not dynamically coupled to the surface it can quickly warm up, as it turns out in matter of weeks. The warmer stratosphere will radiate more infrared radiation both down towards the surface and up to space, the latter resulting in a weakening of $F_{2pct}$ by some amount. Second, clouds might respond to the stronger solar input thereby altering the planetary albedo. This will result in an adjustment term $-\delta \alpha \cdot S_o/4$, meaning that even minute changes in $\alpha$ can have relatively large impacts on the adjusted $F_{2pct}$.

\vspace{0.5 cm}
\noindent
In the following we shall go over two methods to estimate forcing, and then take a closer look at the forcing from CO$_2$. There are of course many other ways the Earth system can be forced, some of which we shall look at in the next chapter in the context of historical warming. 

\section{The Gregory- and the Hansen methods}
There are many ways to estimate the radiative forcing in climate models. Here I will go over the two methods that are most widely used today namely those suggested by Gregory et al. (2004) and Hansen et al. (2005). Both methods build on the idea of the linear framework we developed earlier wherein the energy balance is a function of forcing and feedback:
$$N=F+\lambda T$$
where $F$ and $\lambda$ are assumed to be constants. 

The Gregory-method builds on coupled climate simulations wherein CO$_2$, or any other forcing is abruptly applied whereafter the system slowly warms. Then the parameters $F$ and $\lambda$ can be determined by linear regression of $N$ versus $T$. The best way to see this is to plot yearly mean values of the imbalance as a function of global mean surface temperature change (Figure \ref{fig:gregory_hansen}). Note that in the figure I show a case with quadrupled CO$_2$, or two doublings, rather than the usual single doubling of CO$_2$. The radiative forcing from CO$_2$ is roughly logarithmic in the concentration (Arrhenius 1896) and so if we divide the forcing estimate by two we get an estimate of that from a single doubling. Using 4xCO$_2$, rather than 2xCO$_2$, is popular in the climate modeling community as it increases the ratio of the forced signal over internal variability (noise) when trying to fit simple models to the results, such as we do here. By applying a larger forcing, however, we also risk activating non-linearities that again makes interpretation more difficult.

\begin{figure}[!]

The gray solid line is a linear fit to all 300 years and the gray dashed line is a linear fit to the first 10 years of the simulation. The red dot is the effect of quadrupling CO$_2$ in 30-year long simulations for the period 1979-2008 with the atmosphere-only ECHAM6.3 model wherein the sea surface temperatures are held fixed at their observed values. The red line is an extrapolation back to zero following the Hansen et al. (2005) method. } 
\label{fig:gregory_hansen}
\end{figure}

As we expect for the system to be stable (Chapter 3) the slope of the linear fit is negative; we can identify the slope as the feedback parameter, $\lambda \approx -1.2$ Wm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$. The intercept with the y-axis, i.e. where $T=0$ can then be interpreted as the forcing, $F$. With this method we find an estimate of $F_{4x} \approx 7.34$ Wm$^{-2}$, corresponding to $F_{4x} \approx 3.67$ Wm$^{-2}$ which is not far from our canonical value of 3.7 Wm$^{-2}$. This close agreement, as it shall turn out, is purely coincidental.

Hansen et al. (2005) took a somewhat different approach. They suggested using simulations with atmosphere-only models, wherein the sea surface temperature is held fixed, so as to not allow the system to warm. Often these are referred to as AMIP experiments. One will make two simulations, a control and one with a forcing applied, for instance increased CO$_2$. If $T=0$ we simply have that the forcing equals the change in the radiation imbalance. Unfortunately -- or perhaps fortunately -- the whole Earth is not covered only by ocean, and so the land and sea ice covered regions can change their temperatures in response to the changed atmospheric composition. This alters the global mean surface temperature a little bit, for a quadrupled CO$_2$ concentration approximately by 0.5 K. We can write this as:
$$F = N -\lambda \delta T$$
where $N$ is determined from the difference between the two runs, $\delta T$ is the small change in surface temperature and $\lambda$ is taken to be the longterm average slope as determined using the Gregory-method. In figure \ref{fig:gregory_hansen} I display the Hansen method estimate with the red line, yielding $F_{4x} \approx9.2$ Wm$^{-2}$, corresponding to $F_{2x} \approx4.6$ Wm$^{-2}$, or a substantially larger value than found with the Gregory et al. (2004) method.

The two methods can be brought into agreement by relaxing the requirement that $\lambda$ is constant. We note that the first few years the imbalance is somewhat above the longterm mean fitted line. If we fit a line to just the first 10 years we see that the slope is substantially steeper with $\lambda \approx -1.8$ Wm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$ and an intercept close to that obtained with the Hansen-method. 
We shall return to the interesting causes and implications of $\lambda$ not being a constant at several later occasions, however already below we shall see that it has something to do with clouds.

\section{Components of the radiative forcing from CO$_2$}
So far we have focussed on the total forcing from e.g. an increase in atmospheric CO$_2$. But it is useful to also separate them out to better appreciate how the forcing comes about. Here we note that we can separate the total imbalance change into contributions from CO$_2$ itself, as well as temperature, water vapor, clouds and surface albedo, and we shall then assume they are linear in global mean surface temperature change:
\begin{eqnarray}
N &\approx& \sum{ N_i}    \label{eq:prp} \\
 &\approx&  N_{CO_2} +  N_{T} +  N_{W}  +  N_{C}  +  N_{A}\nonumber  \\
  &\approx& F^*_{2xCO_2} + F_T  + F_W + F_C + F_A + \left(\lambda_T + \lambda_W + \lambda_C + \lambda_A \right)\cdot T\nonumber \\
  &=& F_{2x} + \lambda \cdot T \nonumber
%  \label{eq:prp}
\end{eqnarray}
where $F^*_{2xCO_2}$ is the direct radiative flux response to a doubling of CO$_2$ and we have assumed that it does not depend on the temperature. This is not entirely correct, and there are in fact good arguments as to why the direct forcing should increase in a warmer climate. In MPI-ESM1.2 there is a small slope of about 0.03 Wm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$, that however can safely be neglected for the considerations here.

In Figure \ref{fig:mpi-esm1.2_PRP} I plot all the terms in equation \ref{eq:prp} as well as linear regressions for each term. We see that for all components but clouds, the linear approximation works surprisingly well in this model. Further, for two components, namely surface albedo and water vapor, there is a near-zero y-intercept. This means that these components do not contribute to forcing, but can be considered pure climate change feedbacks. Careful inspection reveals a slightly negative y-intercept for surface albedo, which is due to the fact that it takes 1-2 years for sea ice to melt in response to warming (Block and Mauritsen 2013).

\caption{ Separation of contributions to imbalance as in equation \ref{eq:prp} for the MPI-ESM1.2 coupled climate model run presented in Figure \ref{fig:gregory_hansen}. Solid lines are fitted by linear regression over the full 300 years, whereas the two dashed lines are fitted over the first 10 years of the simulation. The separation is done using so-called partial radiative perturbations (PRP) which involves making multiple radiation calls with state-variables replaced by those from a control simulation. } 
\label{fig:mpi-esm1.2_PRP}
\end{figure}

Non-zero y-intercepts are found for temperature ($N_T$) clouds ($N_C$) and the direct CO$_2$ forcing ($F^*$). In MPI-ESM1.2 roughly half of the total forcing is due to $F^*$ itself, whereas fast temperature and cloud adjustments contribute nearly equal amounts. The direct forcing can be understood from our considerations in Chapter 2 where we argued that increasing the emissivity of the atmosphere reduces the infrared radiation to space because the atmosphere is, for the most part, colder than the surface. Next, we will try to understand the other two components.

\subsection{Stratospheric adjustment to CO$_2$}
The initial positive contribution to the radiation balance by temperature (Figure \ref{fig:mpi-esm1.2_PRP}) may seem puzzling at first. Actually, the only way this can happen is if a part of the climate system cools in response to the increase in CO$_2$; this happens to be the stratosphere. To show this, I plot global mean temperature profiles from the two simulations with prescribed sea surface temperatures that we used to estimate forcing with the Hansen et al. (2005) method above. We see how the tropospheric temperature is hardly changed, but the stratosphere is around 10-15 K colder in the case with quadrupled CO$_2$ and the stratopause and mesosphere are even colder. 
A cooling stratosphere can also be observed on Earth and in the period of about 1960-2010 it cooled off by about 1.5 K. In the same period CO$_2$ concentration rose from 320 to 390 ppm.


\begin{figure}[!]

\caption{ Globally averaged temperature in experiments with prescribed sea surface temperatures. The black is the standard AMIP experiment with ECHAM6.3 for the period 1979-2008, whereas the red profile shows temperatures in an experiment wherein CO$_2$ is quadrupled. These are the same experiments used to estimate forcing with the Hansen method. } 
\label{fig:stratospheric_adjustment_profiles}
\end{figure}

The stratosphere is primarily in a radiative equilibrium between sunlight absorbed by oxygen and ozone and a net heat loss of infrared radiation. The stratosphere receives some infrared radiation from lower levels, but looses more through emission so that the net is negative.
As we saw in Chapter \ref{chapter:essentials} the infrared emissivity of the stratosphere is controlled mostly by CO$_2$, ozone and very small amounts of water vapor. In an exercise we saw how the infrared spectrum changes a bit around the regions where CO$_2$ and ozone are absorbing depending on whether we observe from 70 km or 18 km height, but even so the changes were not dramatic. Already here we can infer that the stratosphere is very far from an ideal black body, $\epsilon_s \ll 1$, as it is transparent to most of the infrared radiation from lower levels. 
As the CO$_2$ concentration is increase the stratospheric emissivity, $\epsilon_s$, is also increased and so the stratosphere can cool more readily in the infrared. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=12 cm]{../plots/Stratospheric_adjustment_timeseries.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{ Temporal evolution of the clear-sky flux change after quadrupled CO$_2$ at the top-of-atmosphere and at the 200 hPa level just below the tropopause in the ECHAM6.3 model. The dashed line shows the longterm mean change at the top of the atmosphere. } 
\label{fig:stratospheric_adjustment_timeseries}
\end{figure}

Let us consider the energy balance of the stratosphere approximated by a slab that receives energy from the sun's ultraviolet ($f_{UV}$ is about 2 percent of $S_o$) and from the troposphere that radiates upward as a black body with $T_e\approx$ 255 K, and looses heat by radiating up and down:
$$ N_s = f_{UV}*\frac{S_o}{4} + \epsilon_s \sigma T_e^4 - 2\cdot \epsilon_s \sigma T_s^4 $$
where $T_s$ is a bulk stratospheric temperature. By assuming radiation balance ($N_s=0$) and re-arranging we can estimate the emissivity of the stratosphere:
$$ \epsilon_s = \frac{f_{UV}*\frac{S_o}{4}}{\sigma (T_e^4 - 2 T_s^4)} $$
Taking the temperature at around 35 km height as a bulk representation of the stratosphere we can estimate that under base conditions with $T_s\approx$ 230 K we get  $\epsilon_s \approx$ 0.07 and in order to cool off by 10 K then $\epsilon_s$ has to increase to around 0.20 when we quadruple CO$_2$, something which seems reasonable for an optically thin case where emissivity scales nearly linearly with the number of absorbing molecules. Note that these are merely ballpark estimates, and the real-world situation is of course much more complicated with ozone also adjusting to the changed conditions. 

In our ad-hoc definition of fast adjustments we stated that they should happen well within the first year after a forcing has been applied. Now we can estimate the response time of the stratosphere analogous to that developed in Chapter \ref{chapter:evolution} for the mixed-layer model:
$$\tau_s = -C_s \left( \frac{\partial N_s}{\partial T_s}\right)^{-1}$$
It is left as an exercise to show that the response time after a quadrupling of CO$_2$ is about two weeks.  It is worth noting that the response time is inversely proportional to $\epsilon_s$ and so becomes shorter for higher CO$_2$ concentrations. 

\begin{figure}[!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=12 cm]{../plots/MPI-ESM12_abrupt4xCO2_PRP_temperatures.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{ Separation of contributions to imbalance from the components of the temperature response: Planck, lapse-rate and stratosphere as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:planck_LR}. Otherwise as in Figure \ref{fig:mpi-esm1.2_PRP}. The dashed regression line shows the fit to the first 10 years. } 
\label{fig:mpi-esm1.2_PRP_temperatures}
\end{figure}

We can see this process happening in a model in Figure \ref{fig:stratospheric_adjustment_timeseries}. Initially there is more downward flux going out below the stratosphere (200 hPa) than is coming in at the top of the atmosphere. As the stratosphere cools off this radiation deficit is reduced. The flux at 200 hPa is actually quite close to the longterm mean at the top of the atmosphere right from the start. Therefore climate modelers have often in the past used this level to estimate the forcing that will occur after the stratospheric adjustment period. It is, however, problematic to use a fixed pressure level when the tropopause moves up and so nowadays we usually use the Hansen et al. (2005) method to estimate radiative forcing after adjustment. 

In summary, the stratosphere adjusts it's temperature quickly thereby enhancing the radiative forcing from CO$_2$. This is the very foundation of the division we made of the total temperature feedback in Chapter \ref{chapter:response} into the tropospheric Planck and lapse-rate feedbacks, and separate out stratospheric adjustment as a forcing (Figure \ref{fig:planck_LR}). We can see how well this works in MPI-ESM1.2 in Figure \ref{fig:mpi-esm1.2_PRP_temperatures} where we see that the stratospheric contribution to the radiation balance has the intercept at around 3 Wm$^{-2}$ and nearly zero slope, i.e. zero feedback parameter. The Planck and lapse-rate components have practically zero y-intercept, that is do not contribute to forcing, but substantial slopes and are hence asserting strong feedbacks.


\subsection{Cloud adjustments to CO$_2$}
Less than a decade ago Gregory and Webb (2008) found that in addition to the stratosphere also clouds can add to the forcing through fast adjustment processes; that is, in some respects clouds respond directly to a change in CO$_2$. Before this time climate scientists would run their models to equilibrium and assume that all changes to the clouds were temperature-dependent feedbacks. 

\begin{figure}[!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=14 cm]{../external_figures/aclcov_BOT_echam-6302p4_amip4xCO2_197.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{ Cloud cover response to quadrupled CO$_2$ in simulations with ECHAM6.3 and fixed sea surface temperatures for the period 1979-2008. In the global mean the cloud cover is reduced by almost 1 percent. } 
\label{fig:cloud_cover_adjustment}
\end{figure}

We have already seen that in MPI-ESM1.2 -- depending how one counts -- more than half the total change in the radiation balance originating from clouds happens quickly, well within the first year (Figure \ref{fig:mpi-esm1.2_PRP}). We can investigate this fast adjustment using the same experiments that we used in the  Hansen et al. (2005) method. The quadrupled CO$_2$ induces a reduction in global mean total cloud cover of about one percent but large regional deviations occur (Figure \ref{fig:cloud_cover_adjustment}). We see that over most of the oceans, whereat the surface temperature is held fixed, there is a nearly general reduction in cloudiness. Over some land-regions, mostly those associated with monsoons, there is an increase in cloudiness. In the following we shall make qualitative reasoning as to why these two counteracting phenomena occur.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=12 cm]{../illustrations/Stratocumulus_dynamics.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{ Illustration of the key processes involved in low-level stratocumulus clouds: longwave cooling near cloud-top causes condensation and convective instability that drives mixing within the cloud. } 
\label{fig:stratocumulus_dynamics}
\end{figure}

A large class of clouds, in particular over the oceans, are stratiform in nature. The best known is sub-tropical low-level stratocumulus. These are caused by radiative longwave cooling at the cloud-top that cause condensation and convective mixing (Figure \ref{fig:stratocumulus_dynamics}). They mostly occur below a temperature inversion and usually the troposphere above is dry and relatively clear. Under such conditions the cloud-top cooling is particularly strong. In case-studies one can find how stratocumulus thin when a cloud passes by aloft; the upper cloud radiates down towards the stratocumulus thereby reducing the cloud-top cooling. The same phenomenon happens when we increase the atmospheric CO$_2$: the down-welling infrared radiation near cloud top increases due to the higher emissivity of the atmosphere thereby reducing the net cooling. The result is a reduction in this type of clouds within a matter of minutes to hours.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=9 cm]{../illustrations/Land_sea_breeze_CO2_illustration.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{ Illustration of the monsoon-circulation cloud adjustment to increased CO$_2$. } 
\label{fig:landseabreeze}
\end{figure}

Some tropical land regions see instead increased cloudiness in response increased CO$_2$ in MPI-ESM1.2 (Figure \ref{fig:cloud_cover_adjustment}). They occur over the major monsoon regions, with the notable exception of the Amazon (probably a model bias), ranging from a few up to 10 percent increase in cloud cover over parts of Africa, the Middle East, Australia etc. I believe the reason is that land warms up faster than the ocean (in this simulation the ocean cannot warm), which causes an increased land-sea temperature contrast that drives stronger monsoon circulations (Figure \ref{fig:landseabreeze}). The result is more deep clouds forming over most of tropical lands, in particular upper-level ice clouds.

Cloud adjustments to CO$_2$ are the main source of uncertainty in radiative forcing from CO$_2$. If it wasn't for clouds we would know $F_{2x}$ with very high accuracy, some cite 3.72 Wm$^{-2}$, but clouds introduce model uncertainty of 10-20 percent.

\chapter{Historical warming}

The recent global warming found in the instrumental record plays a central role in the debate over anthropogenic climate change. It is the best observed example of climate change we have, but unfortunately it is caused by a large number of factors that complicates interpretation.

\section{Historical forcings}
Human activity, the sun and volcanoes have had important impacts on the Earth's radiation balance in the past few centuries. In chapter \ref{chapter:forcing} we had a more detailed look at CO$_2$ forcing and the associated adjustments, but there are many other ways that human activity affects climate and CO$_2$ is probably just half of the sum off all positive impacts by human activities. Figure \ref{fig:ipcc_forcing} displays the many different components and estimates of their uncertainties. We could probably spend a lecture on each of them, just like we did it for CO$_2$, but in the interest of here I explain them only roughly and estimate the timescales involved:

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
%\setlength\itemsep{0 cm}
\itemCO$_2$ is emitted from fossil fuel burning and is partly stored on a short timescale in the atmosphere, partly in vegetation and the upper ocean. It is the most important positive forcing. CO$_2$ is chemically inert, and is only slowly removed into the deep ocean and eventually sediments on timescales of centuries to multiple millennia. 
\item Other well-mixed greenhouse gases also contribute substantial positive forcing. These tend to have somewhat shorter life-times than CO$_2$, e.g. CH$_4$ stays in the atmosphere for about 10 years. 
\item Ozone change due to human activity include ozone depletion in the stratosphere and ozone increases in the troposphere as a result of pollution. The latter is more important. The lifetime of the related pollutants are roughly days to months in the troposphere and decades for those affecting ozone in the stratosphere.
\item Stratospheric water vapor can increase over natural levels due to methane oxidation (2O$_2$ + CH$_4 + \nu \rightarrow $ CO$_2$ + 2H$_2$O). The lifetime of stratospheric water is several years.
\item Land-use change from e.g. forests to agriculture has made the surface of the Earth slightly brighter, and therefore exerts a small negative forcing.
\item Contrails from high-altitude air traffic create additional cirrus clouds which have a small warming effect because they reduce the infrared radiation to space. The lifetime of these clouds are of the order of days.
\item Aerosol particles due to human activities exert a negative forcing on the Earth, both directly by reflecting sunlight back to space and through cloud adjustments. Some aerosol particles can also preferentially absorb sunlight thereby having a warming effect, in particular over bright surfaces. The clouds adjust to aerosol particles for instance because cloud droplets require an aerosol particle that can act as condensation nuclei. There are many processes involved and therefore estimates are uncertain. The typical lifetime of aerosol particles is a week.
\end{itemize}
In Figure \ref{fig:historical_forcing} I display the evolution in time of the best estimates of some of the more important components.




\vspace{0.5 cm}
\noindent
The natural forcing arises mostly from solar variability and volcanic eruptions. The sunlight input can vary if the either the Earth's orbit changes or the solar activity affects the solar irradiance. Over the period of about 150 years the orbit does not change much, this is more relevant at timescales of 10,000 years and longer; the so-called Milankovitch cycles thought to control the ice-ages. The irradiance varies also over long timescales, but it also has a distinct cycle around 11 years, clearly visible in Figure \ref{fig:historical_forcing}. This cycle plays for instance a role in the flattening of the forcing in the first decade of the 21st Century.
The strong negative spikes in volcanic forcing happens when volcanoes are explosive enough to inject material into the stratosphere. If the material does not make it up to the stratosphere it is generally precipitated out in a matter of weeks, but once in the stratosphere it can stay aloft for a year or longer and therefore begin to have an appreciable impact on the temperature. Except perhaps for Pinatubo that erupted in 1991, the forcing of individual volcanic eruptions are not very well known. 

The plot of the forcing since 1850 can be deceiving in at least two ways. First, anthropogenic forcing wasn't exactly zero in 1850. The greenhouse gas forcing was already estimated to be around +0.3 Wm$^{-2}$ relative to 1750, but it is thought that the early industry emitted enough aerosol to compensate the greenhouse gas forcing in the global mean. The second point is more subtle and relates to how we think of volcanoes. These are a natural, and for all we know, randomly occurring cooling. So a system that is not forced by human activity will see an average forcing of the longterm mean and equilibrate with it, and so the best way to think of volcanic forcing is in terms of deviations from this mean. This also means that periods without volcanoes will be warmer than usual, implying that actually the volcanic forcing is positive. It is left as a project to estimate the effect of how we handle volcanic forcing.

\caption{ Temperature evolution in the two-layer model with the historical forcing estimates displayed in Figure \ref{fig:historical_forcing}.

\label{fig:historical_two-layer}
\end{figure}

We can take the forcing time series and apply them to the two-layer model, equations \ref{eq:twolayer-deep}-\ref{eq:twolayer-ml}, we developed in Chapter \ref{chapter:evolution}. The result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:historical_two-layer}, where I have run the model for both the combined forcing and for the individual components shown in Figure \ref{fig:historical_forcing}. We see that the two-layer model does a decent job in matching the observed warming, whereby one should remember that the two-layer model does not exhibit natural variability such El Ni\~no, which is visible in the global mean temperature in for instance in 1997/98 and in 2015/16. 


\section{Interpreting historical warming}
It has now become popular to try to infer $ECS$ from the historical warming. 
I showed in chapter \ref{chapter:evolution} that the two-layer model can be reduced to the zero-layer model with reasonable approximation if the forcing changes gradually on decadal time-scales. I repeat the zero-layer model here:
$$T(t) = \frac{F(t)}{\gamma-\lambda}$$
and the planetary imbalance is:
$$N(t) = \gamma T(t),$$
where we remember that $\lambda$ is the feedback parameter which is negative for stable systems, and $\gamma$ is the deep ocean heat uptake coefficient which is on the order of 1 Wm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$.
Now we are interested in estimating Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity, $ECS=-F_{2x}/\lambda$, based on the observed warming. If we assume the zero-layer model applies we may simply compare two different times, $t_1$ and $t_2$, since $T$ and $F$ are proportional and define differences such that e.g. $\Delta T = T(t_2)-T(t_1)$ to get:
$$\Delta T = \frac{\Delta F}{\gamma-\lambda}$$
and 
$$\Delta N = \gamma \Delta T.$$
Next, we can eliminate $\gamma$ by combining the two equations, and then insert the definition of $ECS$ in order to obtain:
$$\Delta T = \frac{\Delta F}{\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta T}+\frac{F_{2x}}{ECS}}$$
and re-arrange in order to isolate $ECS$:
\begin{equation}
ECS = \frac{F_{2x}\cdot \Delta T}{\Delta F - \Delta N}.
\label{eq:zero_ecs}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Now we see that the problem of determining ECS boils down to estimating the change in temperature, forcing and planetary imbalance between two periods. The periods can in principle be chosen freely, it is not required that one period is at stationarity. It is, however, important that the assumptions made in the zero-layer model are reasonable fulfilled, for instance that the forcing is changing gradually on decadal time-scales. Looking at figure \ref{fig:historical_forcing} we see that volcanic forcing is the perfect counter-example of a gradually changing forcing. This leaves us with periods in the late 19th Century, one in the mid-20th Century and the early 21st Century. In table \ref{table:input} I provide the difference between the former and the latter. 

\begin{table}

Inserting values from Table \ref{table:input} in Equation \ref{eq:zero_ecs} we obtain $ECS \approx$ 1.78 K. This number is fairly low compared to suggestions that $ECS$ likely is between 1.5 and 4.5 K, a result that has puzzled scientists in the past five years. There are a number of suggestions out there for why these estimates are low-biased ranging from the temperature record not having global coverage, that feedback is non-constant between decadal and centennial timescales, natural variability, to forcings act differently and cannot simply be added.

Here we shall instead look at what the uncertainty in each term in equation  \ref{eq:zero_ecs} means for uncertainty in $ECS$ inferred by this method. It is not so straight-forward (I believe it is impossible) to use regular error-analysis that you might have learned in earlier courses because of the division by a difference. Further, not all errors are independent. For instance the change in $\Delta F$ contains a contribution from CO$_2$ that has errors that are dependent on errors in $F_{2x}$. Therefore we resort to Monte-Carlo sampling.

In Monte-Carlo sampling methods you assume probability-distribution functions for all terms in the expression you are interested in estimating (e.g. equation \ref{eq:zero_ecs}), then draw random samples from those distributions. The random samples are then used to evaluate random estimates of the expression. Here we shall use the gaussian distribution, referred to as the normal distribution. In Python you can the ask for example for 10 samples from the gaussian distribution with mean equal 0.0 and standard deviation of 1.0 as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
   > import numpy as np
   > np.random.normal(0.0, 1.0 , 10)
      1.52  -0.31  -0.28  -0.18  -0.52  0.16  0.71  1.24  0.81  -0.58 
\end{verbatim}
If you would sample enough, perhaps a few million times, and plot the probability distribution you would get something very close to a gaussian distribution.

Now we can do the same for each quantity in equation \ref{eq:zero_ecs}. We will simply assume that they are gaussian with the standard deviations listed in Table \ref{table:input}. Already by looking at the uncertainties it is clear that the numerator is fairly well constrained with errors of about 10 percent, but the denominator $(\Delta F - \Delta N)$ can cause more uncertainty in $ECS$. This is particularly the case if $\Delta F$ becomes small so that we divide by a small number and $ECS$ can become large. 
In figure \ref{fig:ECS_inferred_forcing} I plot the non-aerosol and the aerosol forcing, and their sum. We see how aerosol forcing is assumed much more uncertain than the uncertainty in all other forcing components together, and that aerosol forcing is dominating the uncertainty in total forcing. We can understand this as for independent random errors the standard deviations add in quadrature, such the standard deviation of the total forcing is the square root of the sum of squared standard deviations:
$$ \sigma_{total} = \sqrt{\sigma_{aerosol}^2 + \sigma_{non-aerosol}^2}$$

\caption{ Monte-Carlo sampled forcing change used to estimate $ECS$ from historical warming. I plot probability distributions for aerosol, non-aerosol and total forcing change. } 
\label{fig:ECS_inferred_forcing}
\end{figure}

With the resulting distribution of $\Delta F$, and likewise randomly sampled $\Delta T$ and $\Delta N$, we can now calculate a corresponding distribution of $ECS$ following equation \ref{eq:zero_ecs} as displayed in Figure \ref{fig:ECS_inferred}. We see that the method results in a highly skewed distribution giving most weight to lower-end $ECS$ and a long tail towards higher values (actually, a few samples have $ECS > \infty$). Given the strong weight on low-end $ECS$ this type of estimates is somewhat at odds with other evidence suggesting $ECS$ is most likely around 3 K, or sometimes higher. One possible reason for this could be that the feedback parameter is different when the system is out of balance; an effect we shall investigate in the next chapter.

The median value and the 5-95 percent interval of the distribution is printed. Here I have additionally sampled $F_{2x}$ in such a way that it correlates with greenhouse gas forcing, though this has  little impact on the results and can be ignored. }

\chapter{Projects}

Below I describe the projects. There is quite a diversity to choose from, and I expect you need to spend 5-10 hours on it, including making the experiments work and looking for background information. 
Each group or person gets to show two slides. One with the project title and the participant names on it; the slide can be used to introduce the problem/idea. The second slide will show the main result or finding. In each project I may ask several questions, but you get to choose what you find most interesting and present it, and/or think of other questions on your own, as inspired by the project. Please make sure graphics are clear, axes and lines are correctly labeled and colors, lines and symbols are well-chosen for clarity. Do not clutter the second slide with many small figures.

\vspace{0.5 cm}
\noindent
You need to provide your slides to me before the presentation lecture, preferably via email. The safest is to convert it to pdf format. The presentations will take no more than 5 minutes each. 

\vspace{0.5 cm}
\noindent
If you are stuck in any way I am available via email and will likely respond within a day; please make sure to describe your issue explicitly and, if applicable, also the computer and programs you are using.

\section{Attribution of historical warming}
Suppose that more than a hundred years of research is wrong and the well-mixed greenhouse gases have no effect on the Earth's radiation balance. Could the historical warming then still be forced? 
If all we know is the global mean temperature then you can begin to explore this idea with the two-layer model by rescaling the different components in the historical forcing. Create at least two sets of scaling factors, $S_i$, such that:
$$F = 0\cdot F_{CO_2} + S_{aero}\cdot F_{aero}+ S_{solar}\cdot F_{solar} + ...$$
where the CO$_2$ and other well-mixed greenhouse gas forcings are scaled to zero, but compensated by other forcings to obtain a reasonable match with observed warming. Remember that you can also use negative $S_i$ to make for instance aerosol or stratospheric ozone forcing positive. %You may for instance present the two, or more, rescaled runs together with the standard setup with $S_i=1$ and judge their ability to explain global warming, but the floor is open.
For this project you can use the provided two-layer model setup to run the historical case.

\vspace{0.5 cm}
\noindent
{\em More formal attribution efforts will use other information than just the global mean temperature. Different forcings have characteristic patterns, fingerprints, that can be estimated using complex climate models and used to show that most of the $S_i$ are close to one.  }


\section{The underwater volcano}
As in the previous project, suppose we are all mistaken and that the greenhouse gas forcing is zero, and instead global warming is caused by geothermal heat seeping out of the seabed, e.g. through volcanoes. You must now introduce a deep ocean forcing $F_d$ into the two-layer model equation for the deep ocean:
$$C_d\frac{dT_d}{dt} = \gamma(T-T_d) + F_d$$
In the Python code you can do this by inserting an additional argument to the twolayermodel function interface. You now have to invent a forcing time series and adjust its strength such that the model roughly reproduces the observed warming. You may choose to keep some of the non-greenhouse gas forcing components, if you like, though at least the ordinary volcanos and solar forcing should be retained.

One way you might illustrate that this is a bad idea is to calculate the sea level rise that would occur. If you assume the ocean water approximately expands at a rate of roughly $1.5\cdot 10^{-4}$ K$^{-1}$, and remembering that the two-layer model is set up to represent a 75 m mixed-layer plus a 1000 m deep ocean, estimate the sea-level rise to demonstrate that we would have had were global warming due to underwater volcanos.


\section{Create a hiatus}
The surface warmed more slowly than expected from 1998--2012, an event which many people call `the hiatus'. One possible explanation for the hiatus is that we forgot to account for certain forcings in models: e.g. the solar-cycle minimum or stratospheric aerosols due to small volcanic eruptions during this period. Reproduce a hiatus in the 2-layer model. Ramp up the forcing incrementally to $F_{2x}$ over 70 years and then hold the forcing constant out to year 140. Produce a second run, but this time try to keep the temperature evolution after year 70 constant by decreasing the forcing at a constant rate from year 70 onward.  This code might be useful:
\begin{verbatim}
    nyears             = 140
    forcing_years      = np.arange(0,nyears)
    input_forcing      = f2x*np.linspace(0.,2.,nyears)
    input_forcing[70:] = input_forcing[70]
    ...
\end{verbatim}
What is the average forcing change in Wm$^{-2}$ needed in the first 15 years relative to the constant forcing case? Note here that the output of the model is monthly means. What average forcing change would you need to produce a constant temperature after year 70 in the zero-layer model? Can you explain the difference between the two models? %Estimates in the literature suggest that the neglected forcings should be around --0.2 to --0.3 Wm$^{-2}$; do you think these forcings could explain the hiatus?


\section{Estimating the forcing from CO$_2$ all the way from zero}
We usually assume that the forcing from CO$_2$ is logarithmic in concentration such that $F_{4x} \approx 2\cdot F_{2x}$ and $F_{8x} \approx 3\cdot F_{2x}$, $F_{0.5x} \approx -F_{2x}$ etc. which is a finding we owe to Svante Arrhenius' epic study from 1896. But how far does the logarithmic assumption work? To investigate this you will use the MODTRAN model to investigate this. You can start from the standard 400 ppm and go up through consecutive doublings e.g. to 6400 ppm and likewise down by halving the concentration. Also figure out what is the total forcing between 0 and 400 ppm. Repeat the exercise with the observer at both 70 km height and also at the tropopause at 18 km height to see how the stratosphere will adjust. You may plot the result and figure out over which range the logarithmic assumption works reasonably, or focus on how stratospheric adjust depends on the CO$_2$ level.


\section{Modeling natural variability}
The two-layer model does not exhibit natural variability on its own. But we can model the effect of 'weather' by introducing random year-to-year variation in the radiation balance. This is easy to do in the two-layer model; here I create input for a 10000-year long run with random noise sampled from a  gaussian distribution as forcing:
\begin{verbatim}
     nyears = 10000
     forcing_years = np.arange(0,nyears)
     input_forcing = np.random.normal(0,1,nyears)
\end{verbatim}
If you plot the time-series of mixed-layer and deep ocean temperatures you will notice there is considerable low-frequency variability despite the fact that the year-to-year forcing is random. The heat reservoirs act as a memory that bears resemblance to random walk, brownian motion or red noise (Hasselmann 1976). There is, however, a restoring force through the feedback parameter that keeps the system in place and tends to dampen variability. Explore the controls of natural variability in this system, e.g. by changing $ECS$. It may come in handy to compare power-spectra between the mixed-layer and deep ocean, and between runs with different settings. Here is an example of how this can be done:
\begin{verbatim}
     frequency = np.linspace(0,12/2,nyears/2)
     P_ml = np.fft.fft(exp1['T_ml'])
     P_ml = P_ml[0:int(nyears/2)]
     axes.plot(frequency,abs(P_ml)**2)
\end{verbatim}
What happens if you set $ECS$ to a very large number such that $\lambda \rightarrow 0$?

\section{Treating volcanoes in historical simulations}
Often when we run models with historical forcing we first run our models into equilibrium with pre-industrial forcings that do not contain volcanoes, and then treat volcanoes as a negative forcing as done in figures \ref{fig:historical_forcing} and \ref{fig:historical_two-layer}. Gregory et al. (2013) pointed out that this leads to an artificial cooling, in particular of the deep ocean, over the historical period.

Volcanoes, for all we know, occur randomly every now and then and are a part of the natural boundary conditions for the climate system. Therefore it is more reasonable to run the climate model to equilibrium with the volcanic forcing and then start the historical simulation from a slightly colder climate. This can be done in several ways for the two-layer model. 1) One could repeat the record of volcanic forcing, available for 1750-2011 in the IPCC report, over and over again and eventually the temperature will fluctuate around a new mean. 2) Or one could calculate the equilibrium state from the two-layer model equations. 3) Or finally one can subtract the mean volcanic forcing from the volcanic forcing such that it is on average zero. Either way the result will be a simulation that does not drift due to volcanos. 

Use the provided two-layer model set up to run the historical case to figure out what the impact is of including volcanos in the pre-industrial state. You could look at both the mixed-layer and deep ocean temperatures to figure out what is going on. If you were to take the standard setup that drifts and increase the $ECS$ in that model, then how high would it need to be to achieve the same amount of warming as the non-drifting version? 


\section{Estimate $ECS$ from historical warming}
Write a program that reproduces Figure \ref{fig:ECS_inferred} by evaluating equation \ref{eq:zero_ecs} using Monte-Carlo sampling. As input you can use the estimates provided in Table \ref{table:input} and assume that the probability distributions of all entities are gaussian. Explore how sensitive the results are to the input, e.g. the assumed mean and standard deviation for aerosol. What would it take to make the median estimate larger than, say 3.0 K?
To do this exercise in Python, you need to load relevant modules, and sample each entity a large number of times. In this example I make a million samples (note that some computers may have trouble with large sample sizes) of the temperature change:
\begin{verbatim}
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     import numpy as np
     import scipy.stats as stats

     nsamp = int(1e6)

     delta_T = np.random.normal(0.77, 0.08, nsamp)
     ...
\end{verbatim}
Then plot the results probability distribution function. You can also use the scipy.stats package to calculate the 5 and 95 percentiles of your samples, e.g for the 5th percentile:
\begin{verbatim}
     stats.scoreatpercentile(samples,5)
\end{verbatim}
The method of estimating $ECS$  with equation \ref{eq:zero_ecs} was first invented by Gregory et al. (2002), and later updated and refined by Otto et al. (2013) and Lewis and Curry (2014).


\section{Fit two-layer model to GCM}
We often assume that the feedback parameter $\lambda$ is a constant, but if one forces some climate models with more the $F_{2x}$ then they start to exhibit non-linearities. In the MPI-ESM1.2 coupled climate model we have a quite rapid increase of $ECS$ from less than 3 K for one doubling and up to 10 K for the fourth doubling ($F_{8x} \rightarrow F_{16x}$). Bloch-Johnson et al. (2015) suggested that this model behavior could be described as a simple Taylor expansion of the feedback parameter such that:
$$\lambda(T) = \lambda_o + b*T + ...$$
where $\lambda_o$ and $b$ are coefficients. 
Now take the standard two-layer model and load in data from a set of 1000-year simulations with MPI-ESM1.2 with abruptly applied 2, 4, 8 and 16 times pre-industrial CO$_2$, plotting $N$ versus $T$ for each experiment as in Figure \ref{fig:gregory_hansen}. You can assume forcing is logarithmic in CO$_2$ concentration, but you may need to adapt to the specific model's $F_{2x}$ as described in chapter \ref{chapter:forcing}. Next, try to find $\lambda_o$ and $b$ such that the two-layer model reasonably matches the complex model. What happens if you force the two-model with these parameter settings harder?

You can load the netcdf files from the MPI-ESM1.2 experiments into Python and calculate the surface temperature and top-of-atmosphere imbalance using for instance this command:
\begin{verbatim}
     from scipy.io import netcdf
     mpiesm_2x = netcdf.netcdf_file('mpiesm-1.2.00_abrupt2xCO2_anomaly.nc')
     N_2x = mpiesm_2x.variables['trad0'][:,0,0]+bot.variables['srad0'][:,0,0]
     T_2x = mpiesm_2x.variables['tsurf'][:,0,0]
\end{verbatim}
The files have already been globally and annually average, and I have subtracted the control simulation values.
